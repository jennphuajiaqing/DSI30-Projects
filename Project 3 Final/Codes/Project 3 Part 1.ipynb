Livestream yoga is the only digital class type in the top 10 most booked classes and appointments. In-studio yoga has climbed to the second most popular class type since studios have reopened. It’s likely that the at-home yoga spike produced some new students, and that both new and seasoned yogis are excited to practice with a community again.\n",

    "Yoga and Pilates are often compared as they have many similarities but the two are inherently very different forms of exercise. They are both low-impact exercise and are able to offer connection to the body and relief stress while developing flexibility, strength, control and endurance. One can understand more from the article from Harpers Bazaar ([*source*](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/fitness-wellbeing/a25626354/yoga-vs-pilates/)).\n",

    "But the biggest difference between the two is the emphasis on the spiritual side in Yoga classes. Yoga is an integrated health management system using breath, movement and meditation to unite mind, body and spirit. Also there are different types of Yoga like 'Hatha Yoga', 'Power Yoga', 'Hot Yoga' and many more.\n",

    "While Pilates is a physical system that uses very specific targeted exercises to improve strength, flexibility and posture with particular focus on the core. Pilates are mainly split into 'Mat Pilates' or 'Classical Pilates'.\n",

    "Pilates have been on an upwards trend in terms of popularity and accessibility. Pilates was invented by Joseph Pilates more than a century ago. Due to covid, gyms were closed and we were all confined to our homes. Thanks to social media being the driving force behind the recent resurgence of the low-impact workout, awareness for Pilates was increased. As we had to look for new ways to work out that involved minimal equipment that are generally accessible and easy to follow with just a mat and a resistance band while watching online videos.
