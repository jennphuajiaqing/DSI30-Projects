yoga,Ankle Swelling From Yoga?,"I recently signed up for a 30 day pass to a local hot yoga studio and am committed to attending a class every day—even if I cannot make it through an entire class.

I’ve done some stretching and yoga in the past, but it’s been about a year since I consistently worked out, let alone practiced yoga.

I’ve noticed after four days that my ankles are very swollen. Has anyone else had this experience and know what it’s attributable to, or how I can treat/prevent it?"
yoga,Are cork yoga mats better than a regular mat?,I find that I get a better workout with no mat because the mat makes me want to lie on it and idk I’m just not a fan. But idk if it’s a good idea to workout on the floor? What about a cork yoga mat? Is it hard like the flor? Thx
yoga,Found My New Yoga Studio,"I just moved to Henderson, NV a while ago.

Seriously, what's with desert locals and hot yoga/bikrum during the summer? Is the outside heat torturing them enough!?"
yoga,We have started going to classes!,"I’m sure you get these kind of posts frequently, but my husband and I have just started going to free Yoga classes at the community center in our city. We’re both pretty out of shape and sedentary, and I specifically am very overweight. We just did our second class yesterday and we do so sore but it’s very fun! Excited to continue on this journey!"
yoga,How long did it take you to get good at yoga?,"I'm struggling with core strength at the moment, and that's because I used to occasionally run and stretch only.

yoga,Why can I manage a figure 4 squat but not a pistol squat?,"I can do a (shaky) figure 4 squat, so it seems like I should have the strength and balance to manage a pistol squat, but I’m not even close. I do bridges regularly to increase glute strength, and am an avid runner, but my balance is pretty poor. It looks so easy on those You Tube tutorials! 😂"
yoga,Group Classes for Inversions,"Are there any yoga chains/classes that practice inversions?

I’ve seen lots of upside down yogis at CorePower and other studios, but never found a class that teaches them specifically. They’re always an advanced modification that some people bust out.

Practicing at home is challenging with small kids and distractions. Looking for a group setting where I can get feedback/corrections.

Thank you!"

yoga,Should I practice if I’m sore?,"So I did some hip stretches yesterday and today they are sore. I intend to do yoga everyday. However, given that my hips are sore, should I skip today or go ahead but go by how I feel?"
yoga,"Sharp pain in calf when straightening legs, fine in passive stretches","I'm wondering if anyone has had this issue or has an idea of how to fix it - I'll preface this with I've had long periods of time off and being sedentary in between regular practice so I don't think it's a muscle tear that didn't have time to recover.

Whenever I go to straighten my legs actively I get a sharp, searing pain in my left calf (if I were to go from chair pose for example or otherwise having my legs bent to putting my hands on the floor and trying to straighten my legs to a standing forward fold, for example, I'll get this sharp pain in my calf. It also happens if I get into pyramid or triangle pose with more than a micro-bend in my knee and then try to straighten my leg more. It also happens sometimes (but not always) if I do an active moving back and forth between a half split and hip flexor stretch (not sure what that's called). 

I usually try to avoid this stuff by fully releasing whatever muscle engagement is going on in my lower body (usually by standing up to mountain pose to reset) and straightening my left leg before folding, but instructors always comment about how that's not what I'm supposed to do if they cued something different, which gets annoying. I don't think it's that I'm over stretching the left calf because I'm actually quite flexible when I get into stretches from a straight leg, it's just the going from bent to straight that's an issue. 

Anyone seen this before or have a possible solution?"
yoga,How to properly get started?,"I’m new to yoga and I’m pretty weak and clumsy when trying to practice because I don’t really work out I ever but I’m trying to change into a healthier me!

I tried doing the 30 day Yoga with Adrian on YouTube however I found 30 minutes at a time to be really killer to the point where I wasn’t able to do it properly and couldn’t keep myself doing it everyday for 30 days. 

I don’t want to entirely give up I think I just need to start slower. I did two of her 15 minute morning yoga videos two days in a row now and left like they were definitely still a challenge but that 15 minutes was doable compared to 30 minutes!

Do you guys think 15 minutes everyday is enough to build skill and more strength so I can work my way up to doing 30 minutes at a time and doing harder poses with more ease?

I’m very new to yoga but I think it’s good for me and that it’s helped my anxiety and depression.

Any advice for a complete beginner who’s struggling to find a routine and a proper start is welcome!!"

yoga,Bulging cervical discs – how to manage pain with yoga?,"Hello yogis, in 2020 I did a headstand without guidance and something cracked in my neck. After that I suffered from months of vertigo and once I did the CT scan and the MRI, it was concluded I have messed up my C4-C7 discs, with most damage to C5-C6. I then spent a few months in PT and last September (almost a year ago) did a course of manual therapy (massage + chiro adjustments, each session for 2 hours) which helped tremendously with the pain. 

I have not been doing yoga for the past 6 months because of grad school but now that it's summer, I wanted to get back into it. I did 2 sessions this week and now feeling a lot of pain in the neck again, as if I aggravated it. I am not doing any advanced poses but definitely feeling like my neck and shoulders are tight again. 

Has anyone managed to heal bulging discs or at least managed to live pain-free through yoga or any other methods (not including surgery). I think the issue is my muscles got super weak so I wonder if I push through the discomfort a bit and strengthen my neck and shoulders to help with the pain?"

yoga,Meditation Bowls: Science-Based Sound Therapies,"Greetings! 

I recently published a book on Amazon about mindful meditation with singing bowls. I'd like to hear from you if you have any feedback for me. 

Book link: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6D7XJ38](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6D7XJ38)

[Meditation Bowls: Science-Based Sound Therapies](https://preview.redd.it/u57p9m86ukc91.png?width=297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d668a91fcc64220d6728cb1e13631d0776756af)

MEDITATION BOWLS introduces you to the history, the culture, and the science behind singing bowls. You will learn how singing bowls can help you discover your own personal path to greater mental and physical health, and how they can help you achieve your goals in everything you do.  


You’ll learn that singing bowls can complement any healing tradition, even that of the science-hardened West. Singing bowls do not dictate your path or guide you along it. Instead, they support the vision and vitality needed for you to discover your own way toward more robust health and greater personal fulfillment.

* Chapter One explores the origins of sound therapy in general and of singing bowls in particular. You’ll discover the history of singing bowls while learning how people have explored the connection between sound and wellness through the years.
* Chapter Two describes the scientific evidence of singing bowls’ efficacy. Sound is a building block of consciousness. Mary offers a detailed yet approachable look at how singing bowls can significantly improve your mental and physical well-being, from improving immune function to combating the effects of stress.
* Chapter Three explores the link between creativity and the state of our brainwaves, and goes on to show singing bowls provide us with the power to amplify our creative capabilities by directly influencing our brainwaves.
* Chapter Four introduces you to the main types of singing bowls—detailing their strengths, their history, and step-by-step instructions on how to play them.
* Chapter Five is all about singing bowls in practice. You’ll get precise and insightful instructions on how to use singing bowls to achieve specific effects, along with guided meditations that you can use right away.
* Chapter Six concludes the book with a discussion of chakras, the body's natural energy centers. Mary didn’t leave her scientific skepticism at the door when she began to explore singing bowls. In this chapter, she offers a fresh, contemporary discussion of chakras as a powerful concept that can heighten the impact of both sound therapy and meditation."
yoga,"Whenever I try belly breathing, after a few breaths I have to stop and heave a big sigh?","I'm trying to learn to breathe from my diaphragm. Wherever I practice diaphragmatic breathing, it seems like I have to stop and take in a large breath using my chest. It's as if I can take in a lot more air when I go back to using my chest. I can do about four belly breaths before I feel the need to breathe with my chest. What am I doing wrong and how do I fix it?"
yoga,Back of my mat is all torn up,"Hi there,

So I do ashtanga yoga daily (primary series). I notice that back of my map is all torn up and I think it's from jumping back into chatarunga dandasana? I've had the mat for like 3 years so it's not too bad. I want to get a new one though and would like this not to happen.

Does this happen to anyone else?
Any tips for preventing this?"
yoga,How long before I will see difference? Yoga twice a day,"Okay so I had a very sedentary lifestyle which caused tight glutes and hips. I started going to the gym and weight lifting about 3.5 months ago. I do 5-6 hours a week in the gym. The issue with my hips and glutes has improved - I can now do lunges and before I could do 0. 

My Chiro told me to start yoga and has also told me to correct my sleeping position and to stop sitting cross legged. So I’m now doing yoga in the morning and in the evening. I do 20mins in the morning and before bed I do 40mins - 60mins. Only beginners poses. 

I can feel a huge difference already after 2 days but how long do you think it will be before my tight muscles are fixed? I know you might not be able to say but if anyone has a similar success story I’d love to hear it! 🥰

Also when I do yoga, when I do savasana at the end my HR can drop to 50 and below, is that normal? I feel very zen after so I’m guessing yes - it’s like the world has slowed down 

And when I did pigeon pose yesterday my hip muscle felt itchy? Not pins and needles but the kind of itchy you feel when a scab is healing- should I be worried?"
yoga,Finding Balance,"Sweat stinging my eyes, forehead pushing into my yoga mat, I found myself again wondering whether I was resting because I needed to or because I was too lazy to keep up with the class. “Is my ‘mind giving up before my body’ or I am ‘listening to what my soul needs today’ I wondered while I panted in savasana through my least favorite parts of class, while jumping up to do the poses I most enjoy.

For some reason that question- finding balance between effort and ease- has followed me throughout the day and shown up in all areas of my life. At work- how much do I push myself for advancement versus seeking my comfort zone? In looking to buy a house- where am I pushing my financial limits versus buying something I can easily afford? Which is the ‘right’ choice anyway? Working through my YTT workbook this evening I realized that those questions are the dance of life. They are the edge of our faith and personal power, where our comfort zone meets the next push of growth. They are also the areas where we start take life seriously- where we stop laughing and start thinking really hard about whether we’re doing things correctly or living up to our potential.

In that moment I remembered- dancing (life) isn’t serious. We often make it serious because it feels like that gives us control- an ability to predict the future or avoid a misstep before it occurs- ""surely that will make life easier"". When really, dancing is easiest when we give in to the dance. The flow state. Where we can tune into subtle cues, laugh at our mistakes and adapt moment by moment; never thinking about changing anything or wonder if we’re trying hard enough.

I wanted to share this in case anyone else gets caught in that mental tug of war between ""trying hard enough"" and desiring rest. Or if you feel like your yoga practice has become a chore. If that is you, here is your reminder to recognize where you are bringing seriousness to this dance of life and choose to flow instead."
yoga,Routine Advice?,"Hi All, 

Just wanted to reach out for some advice on my routine. 

I currently try to do half an hour each morning and do the same Yin Yoga routines i find on youtube - I love Yin and it really helps me get into a good mood in the morning.

yoga,Susanna Barkataki on white yoga teachers. Help me to understand please.,"I am in the process of completing yoga teacher training. I’m starting to have feelings that I regret doing this. 

I am white, cis female. During my 300 hr training, we received a lecture from someone named Susanna Barkataki.  Originally I liked her lecture and I genuinely learned a lot, but then after following her on social media I started to be more confused with her messages. 

1. First, She makes many posts about white yoga teachers being cultural appropriators. Yes, this is a fact and you can see it everywhere.  However one of her examples of this is how white centering can look like studios who use white students as marketing material and who have predominantly white teachers who work there. What happens to local yoga studios who genuinely want to hire diverse teachers but they just haven’t received those applicants due to demographics? Same with their student population. Can they make up for this through doing other things? Should they not post a class preview on their instagram page if it has a bunch of white people in it? I feel like posting these narratives on social media make the public think that factors like this make studios racist and white supremacist.  With that said, I understand that as teachers we need to teach the full scope of yoga tradition so that we are authentic. I just feel that her interpretation of what is happening here is not at all the reality, but makes me feel like I am doing something wrong if my class isn’t diverse enough. 



2. She also considers the idea that it’s not entirely possible for white people to teach yoga given our “post colonial cultural context”. The closest white people can come to being okay as yoga teachers is to constantly practice “harm reduction”.  I acknowledge my privilege fully, and I work to engage in harm reduction by honoring tradition, but I can’t help but now have the contaminating thought that I am an inherently harmful person for doing so and I have to work to reverse the harm that I’ve done.  Yikes.   I feel conflicted, because I disagree with it but also feel shameful at the same time. for arguments sake lets say this isn’t true.. it doesn’t really matter because there are still people who believe this and will judge me for it.


3. My other thought is that Christmas has become something materialistic and capitalistic when it has religious roots. How come people don’t consider this cultural appropriation?  She also has said that you cant pick and choose what works for you, meaning you cant take some aspects of yogic spirituality (or just asana) and ignore others that you dont like.  I fully disagree with this. If you grew up catholic, you can ignore teachings of no sex before marriage (for example) if this doesn’t work for you and you can still honor parts of the Bible that fit your life.  Sometimes meditation doesn’t work for people.  If they fail to commit to this limb of yoga, are they appropriating? 

4. the physical postures of yoga are literally physically and emotionally healing to people and can help extend life and wellbeing. to say that someone is culturally appropriating simply because they are white and are less interested in the spirituality aspects of it is not their fault, and you can’t force someone to be spiritual if it is not their thing. Yoga is not a religion, but it still is similar in that there are spiritual principles that you are supposed to follow in order to live life a certain way. Maybe someone just wants to be more flexible and that is their only goal.  I believe there are ways to appropriately do this without doing harm. 


5. I want to incorporate western elements of mobility into my yoga classes. This does NOT mean cultivating a yoga classes that are actually pilates or mobility and calling it yoga. This means that I want to incorporate modern science to help people protect their joints and have better control over their bodies. ( this could be extremely helpful for seniors who attend) I am now afraid to do this because I do not want people to claim that I am contaminating the roots of yoga as a white person. EVEN if I incorporate lots of yogic spirituality into it. I also think to primarily keep asana tradition is to keep it stagnant in its potential. Yoga can actually sometimes be unsafe for peoples bodies. We need to incorporate science in order to properly and safely teach classes that work for everyone. 

6. With these narratives (wether they are accurate or not) I feel like why would diverse populations even want to take a class from me? She says generally that you should be supporting BIPOC teachers and then says that white teachers have to reduce as much harm as possible when teaching.  Okay but white people are probably going to be the only ones attending my class then with that logic. 


I’m sure there’s some perceptions I have here that aren’t 100% accurate.  I welcome for my opinion to be challenged, that’s how we all learn and grow. There’s many more questions I have but this is Long enough."
yoga,How long do you actually practice for?,"Like most classes are an hour-ish but doesn’t that include setting up / beginning and end chats? I know most studios ask you to arrive 5-10 mins early, but how efficient do you find your class? Or those who practice solo / use an app, how long do you actually find yourself practicing? Do you think the apps are as efficient as classes? 

I was going through my Down Dog practice record and was wondering how long do people generally spend daily on their practice? Do you practice everyday? Aside from dedicated apps, other platforms seem like they only offer quick fix flows ? For example, if you go on Pinterest there’s lots of 20 minute practices, but is this actually useful? Is it for people who “do yoga” ?

I know there are busy people especially those who work/have a family, but surely to be feeling the benefits you should practice longer than 10-20 mins? (am not shaming, genuinely asking)…Obviously the longer you practice the more you build your skill, but how long do you spend dedicated to improving?"

I love the idea of sharing yoga for free, but a lot of people could quickly get involved if I'm teaching in a public space.

yoga,"Beginner, loving yoga!","Hi All!  New to Yoga started end of May.  Since then I’ve completed 46 yoga classes on the Peloton app and I love it.  I’ve been doing Anna Greenberg, love her soothing voice and gracefulness.

I have actually noticed an extreme change in my mood.  To the point where friends and family have mentioned it as well.  I work in a very intense/stressful job and got into yoga because I was always stressed about work.  My anxiety/stress is almost entirely gone since practicing yoga and I am floored by the results.  Doing 30 minutes a day and it’s the only workout I look forward to doing (I also do cardio and lift weights too). 

It’s actually to the point where I am just all around more optimistic about everything in life, work, dating, etc.  and it’s having noticeable positive results on my career now too as I am doing better on meetings and keeping my head focused more throughout the day. 

I know I am just gleaming with positivity about yoga, but I can’t think of anything I’ve seen such improvements more than it.  On top of that, I am feeling more in touch with my body.  I have been eating healthier and working out more, and the other day I had Chinese for take out.  And the next morning I could feel the difference in my body, which is something I’ve never experienced before.  I have heard people say plenty that they can feel the differences in their body with junk food, but I’ve never been able to.  I wanted to thank this community as I researched a lot before diving in!

Does anyone have any great stories about mental health obstacles that were overcome with yoga?  Would love to hear more.

On a side note, I’d love to be able to get some handstand poses in my future, obviously too rookie right now, but watching some of your progress videos and pics are inspiring.  Any advice on working toward those would be awesome!

yoga,Dating …?,"Hey y’all yoga people:)

How can you even date when you’re living a yoga lifestyle?

Okey so;
I’ve been practicing yoga for more than a decade; certified teacher since the last 3 years.
I don’t enjoy drinking (mess up digestion), drugs, going to bed late (juste love early mornings),l and fake things.

I’m always my true self, speaking my truth, open to send and received love and all that chabang.

I’ve been single since over 6 years. 

It’s okay, I’m happy but starting to wonder if I’ll be single until my last breath.(I’m almost 40yrs old)

I don’t have the typical boho/tulum yoga teacher look and I’m not tall and slender (short and muscular) , so all the yoga men’s enthusiasts don’t even look at me.
(Ive Lived in a yoga community for a year; I swear, I repel yoga man)

Over the years, I’ve went on hundreds of dates. Rarely even made it to a bed.

Never actually talked with a guy that wasn’t surprised/turned off that I prefer to spend my Saturday evening doing yoga and meditation than to go have drink or Netflix or party/friends.

Also never met any that was speaking his real truth either… in YEARS of dating.


You know, I often bring dates in nature and I’m always happy and feeling so grateful to be in nature; you’d be surprised how many times I’ve said 
how lucky I feel to be here right now and the dude replied:
 “I’m not lucky at all I’ve work hard to blah blah” and they actually get real mad !!!! And after that it’s weird.

The times I’ve did got to bed was because they weren’t “too” bad.
Every damn time; I’ve felt drained of energy, empty and I kinda regret it.

When you’re feeling awesome alone, if you choose to spend time with someone it should just be even more great, no?!

So tell me; how do you deal with that horrible dating scene yoga folks ?"

I have 2 small kids and life is just getting busier. I keep saying that once they get to school I’ll have more free time but honestly I don’t see it happening. 

And I don’t love everything attached to having a physical space…the overhead, cleaning, stress about paying my staff…

I do have regular offsite class locations. Most are seasonal, flower farms, sunset location on the water, garden locations. But could find some cold weather options 
 
So I guess I want to know if there are any other studio owners that have closed their physical space and just teach offsite, private classes 
And if that works.

I know I will be letting down my staff and my community that I’ve worked so hard to build 
I am having a really hard time with this

To see someone else run it everyday isn’t an option. If I’m done I’m done It’s been my baby I would need closure"

I’m thinking about organizing a yoga meetup (?) in a space in town I can get for free where I provide ideas and maybe lead some poses and offer encouragement and accountability.  However I am only a mediocre beginning yogi at best.  Certainly no guru and I hold no teaching certs.  But maybe we could take turns leading the group or playing one of our favorite YouTubers to practice along with? Idk.  I’m brain storming. Feel free to add ideas or any drawbacks you see please.

yoga,Any Evidence of Asanas being good for kidney stones,"There are a lot of baseless claims in the yoga world, like x pose will detoxify etc.  Logically, I think some twisting poses or inversions might help remove kidney stones. Just wondered if anyone knew of anything evidenced based?

There is evidence jumping is better than running for example

yoga,Torn between 200hr YYT in Guatemala or India,"Hi All!

I have been looking into getting my YTT (not really to teach, but more to deepen my own practice) for years now and I am finally ready to pull the trigger

However, I am torn between two different worlds. 

The first is a YTT in Guatemala at the Yoga Forest with Kula Collective and the second would be to do it in India (not sure of which program yet). Both would be incredible experiences, but I'm having a hard time deciding between the two

The one in Guatemala would:

* have smaller groups and more intimate
* be a bit more woowoo with ceremonial elements like cacao ceremonies (something I am very interested in)
* I love the essence of the program itself a LOT
* However it is MUCH more expensive than in india, it is not in India (a place I have always wanted to visit and i feel like this is THE reason to), and might be a bit too much of a deviation of traditional teachings/philosophy for my first YTT. Sometimes I wonder if this is a place I should come to should I decide to do a 300hr, but we know that is never a sure thing.

The second option is somewhere in India. 

* This is more 'traditional' and also in the birthplace of yoga, which to me is really appealing (and an idea i have had in my head of what i want to do)
* Would be a great foundation for the future with more traditional teachings of yoga 
* It is much cheaper
* But many of the places to do it are much busier and have more students so it is less intimate with less one-on-one support
* I have not yet found a program that really speaks to me

Does anyone have any advice/insights that you might be able to give me? Some other perspectives might help me get out of my own head :) 

Thanks!"
yoga,can I say Namaste in occidental yoga?,"I was curios about the fact that the majority of the time when our yoga master finish the lesson with the word ""namasé"" nonody in my class answer.

yoga,Karma Yoga Question - Am I practicing this teaching correctly?,"In the Bhagavad Gita there is a part that says ""Offer up everything to me. If your heart is united with me, you will be set free from karma in this life, and come to me at last.""

It sounds like I should offer all my actions and thoughts to Krishna.

In practice, does this mean I should take 'my self' out of the situation whenever I do an action. For instance, when I am working, I view myself as 'a person working' with no intentions of reward at the end of this task. I am simply watching myself work without attachment and offering my fruits of my labour to Krishna.

Lastly, while I have been mindfully watching myself, there has negative effects. I wake up in the middle of the night and I don't feel attached to my body because I have been viewing myself in third-person all day. There is fear and an urgency to come back to my body.

Am I doing this correctly?"

yoga,How can you tell the difference between flexibility in your spine vs your hip flexors,"I’ve been practicing for ~2 years now and something that’s always been a weak point for me is back flexibility, but I can’t tell if my limiting factor is my actual spine or due to lack of hip mobility. I’ve been working on pincha and would now like to improve my back bends. 

When I do a forward fold, I am able to place both palms completely on the ground without discomfort (which I attribute to having a long torso). However, when I look in the mirror I can see that the “curvature” of my spine is very rounded (esp upper back) and the “fold” comes at my mid back versus my lower back, unlike the person in this [example](https://www.verywellfit.com/standing-forward-bend-uttanasana-3567133)."

yoga,"Lululemon ""The Reversible"" or ""The Mat"" (5mm) for hot yoga?","Hello everyone,

I am a dancer going into yoga and I've subscribed for a yoga membership with a yoga studio near me. I decided its time to get some yoga essentials (as my mat is 5+ years old) that will help me with sliding, and also being antimicrobial. I've been doing research but can't seem to find a straight answer, which would be the better one to get, ""The Mat"" (more expensive, but not a problem) or ""The Reversible"", what seems to be the difference between them... if any? I do sweat quite a bit in Hot Yoga, so far I've only tried Hatha and deep stretch classes, but It'll likely expand into vinyasa etc. I sweat quite a bit, so like i said my main concerns would be not slipping from sweat, and something that can handle the sweat as well. I'm also unsure if I should get 5mm or 3mm and I know its up to preference, but my thinking is probably the 5mm at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall im planning on getting the following:

1. one of the two mats above

2. yoga mat bag (probably from lululemon) 

3. do you think its necessary to get a yoga mat towel? I'm unsure if I will need it if its necessary

4. face towel as well to help with excessive sweating.

Side note I’m currently a “youngin” in my 20s…. So it felt even more embarrassing. 😅😫
Anyway, the good news is I did some research on Eventbrite yesterday and found some free yoga classes in my area, so I went ahead and signed up for my very first class ever! 
I go tomorrow evening.🥳

I also have social anxiety 😬🥶and often shy away from public settings, and originally I’d wanted my mom and sister to tag along with me so we could experience it together. 😄

Unfortunately they’ve other plans. ☹️

So I’ll be going alone…. By myself… 🫠

But this is the year that I’ve decided that I’m breaking out of my comfort zone. It’s only kept me stagnant and caused me to miss out on a lot of opportunities. No more of that. 👎🙅🏾‍♀️

So I’m killing two birds with one stone: I’ll be practicing yoga, and forcing myself to be more social, without any plus ones or human crutches… Lol
I’m very proud of myself and excited to be embarking on this new adventure! 😇"

yoga,"shallow breathing in the morning, processed as irritability","hello, title says it. i do not explicitly practice yoga but i do practice my own movement/form-based energetic practice, as well as qigong. my partner practices yoga and suggested i post here.

in the mornings i have shallow breathing. this can be interpreted by my body as irritability, ie i do not like being around other people in the morning, but when i pause in these moments to discern what really is going on, i realize i am experiencing the sensory discomfort of shallow breathing and a feeling of restrictedness. this starkly contrasts with how i tend to live (practicing all of the time, very relaxed and devoted to practices, very worryfree) and almost seems to get worse the further along my path i go! it also tracks with my usual coping skill , which is i try to wake up earlier than anyone i might cohabitate with, or go to spaces of solitude, and practice what could look a lot like yoga or meditation to correct my breathing, or alternatively go do my circlings around the mountain or running which is even better really as i could spend hours doing that before i ever have to say any words or have an interaction.. then, i will feel ""ready"" for engaging with other humans, able to offer more freshness without this sensation coming in my body.

this is not very ideal and i know it. i already get a lot of solitude so that is not the problem really.. i don't want to make the mistake of depending upon absolute peacefulness in my environments or else have this ""irritability""/shallow breathing, at this time of day when of course others may be waking up too. how should i approach this issue? should i simply continue doing as i have--wake and practice early in the morning before i am met with any human influences, and try to be mindful of what's really happening in my body physically/energetically so to not have abrasion in my relationships? orrr, is there something i could be missing? does yoga or other practices, lineages, give advice for this?"

I've done suryanamaskar on and off over the years. I want to incorporate it in my daily routine. However, I get exhausted by the time I'm done with 7-8 cycles. I started with 5, continued for about 2 weeks , and increased to 7 and still 9 is the maximum I've reached. 

It's like I can't do any other workout if I do this. I pair it with 5 minutes of Pranayam, after which I need to lie down for some 20 minutes to be able to carry on with the day's activities. I get tired very easily during the day also if I do suryanamaskar.

How long after suryanamaskar can I shower/eat/drink water?"
yoga,Is it appropriate to ask a small studio owner/teacher for discounted classes?,"I live near a very small yoga studio. I’ve taken several drop-in classes there and it’s a terrific spot. One room, no frills, but excellent instruction and nice vibe. Classes are totally reasonably priced. I’ve never been able to afford a membership but I go to classes when I have the time and money. It’s not been a lot lately. In fact, I’m in a really tight spot financially and can’t even pay a reasonable $12 for classes (if I want to go more than once a month, which I do).

My question is this: is it acceptable to ask a studio owner if they’d be willing to offer deep discounts? Not 20% off but (quick math) like 75% off. Normally I’d *never* dream of asking an independent business owner to cater to me and take that hit but—businessly speaking—it’s a bit more money for them for one extra person in class? But it’s a tiny studio and I know every penny counts. And this isn’t how things work in a non bartering society anyway. So honestly, is this way inappropriate? 

(re: Just Doing It At Home, in addition to being broke, I’m also super isolated right now with many stretches of days with no personal human contact. So while I’d normally just try to build better at-home habits for free (love u yoga w adriene), I’d really benefit from just people in the room doing the same thing on their own.)"

Problem is… I carry my mat with a strap (not a bag) and I didn’t realize how big the blocks were until they arrived today (9”x6”x4”) and I got 2 of them since it is how many he uses for some of the postures.

I do weight training right after so I also need to carry my belt, wrist straps and other things to the gym, I have a 20L Herschel backpack and had quite a bit of space but the blocks do not fit. 

Any recommendations for bags that would at least fit the mat AND 2 blocks? Preferably nothing too expensive. Thank you in advanced!"
yoga,Has anyone tried the TVLA Align Mat?,"I'm wondering if anyone has tried the TVLA align mat? It seems like a cheaper version of the Liforme mat, but I can't find many reviews. I do a hot practice and sweat a ton, so I'm looking for a grippy mat."
yoga,What are some sutras you like getting back to and why?,"For me it's 1.33: by cultivating an attitude of friendship towards those who are happy, compassion to those who are in distress, joy towards those who are virtuous, and equanimity towards those who are nonvirtuous, lucidity arises in the mind. 

It's basically a reminder to not treat people badly and to foster positive relationships, even if they are behaving in ways you disapprove of.  

Another one, funnily enough, is 2.33: upon being harassed by negative thoughts, one should cultivate counteracting thoughts.

Very simply and straightforward: if you have negative thoughts, then don't dwell on them, stupid! Something that is easily forgotten."
yoga,"Teachers, can we stop putting TikTok songs on class playlists, please?","I love my practice so much, it’s the one hour of the day where I can truly unplug from the digital world and social media. Yet, as a yogi with ADHD, my focus is totally derailed when I hear a TikTok song come on a class playlist. I can be totally dialed in on my breath, and the sensations in my body, but then that viral sound comes on, and the focus just crumbles. The inner chatter kicks up and tends to goes something like this, “TikTok song. Social Media. Chinese Social Media. Chinese Government. The Chinese Government’s Genocide of Uighur Muslims. So on and so on.” Granted I always take it as an opportunity to practice my meditation and pull my focus back to the breath and body, but personally I’d just rather not have to do that in the first place. Let’s keep the studio the safe space it’s always been, the space of solace and refuge from the outside world, especially the modern digital world that is actively destroying our focus, our minds, and the fabric of our society."
yoga,I’m a 22f who started doing yoga stretches for tight muscles but ended up with really bad knee and hip pain.,Is it normal for it to get worse before it gets better? I know I’m very tight in a lot of areas in my body but this joint pain is scaring me because I think I might’ve overstretched my hamstrings and knees which is giving me a really hard time walking as well. My knee gives up on me when I’m walking sometimes. Has this happened to anyone else and did continuous stretching end up helping? The reason why I blame my (probably imbalanced) stretching is because it is the only new thing I’ve been doing besides my neck physical therapy.
yoga,Need some help with bakasana 💫,"So I've practiced yoga for two years and I'm still not able to do that pose.

Do you have some tips or maybe a tutorial that could help? 🙏"
yoga,[Question] Yoga teacher adjustments,"Hello. I am new here. I wanted to know if my teacher’s adjustments were appropriate. He is very hands on and his adjustments are strong and mostly on point. At the start it felt natural and I didn’t feel comfortable even if he kept pressing my sacrum down when I was in standing forward fold. He will also sometimes trail his fingers (as a habit I suppose?) but they never got to any sensitive / private spots, except for the buttocks sometimes. Towards the end of class, while in seated forward fold, he leaned over me, chest facing downwards on my back, palms pressing my quads down, so my chest was grazing his fingers. He whispered in my ear twice “just like this”. I felt very uncomfortable after that and told myself I will not return to the class (it was a trial). I didn’t straight up leave as I am quite meek and don’t like conflict. Also I wasn’t sure of myself perhaps I was over analyzing ? I wanted to ask if this is okay ? I’m not new to yoga but have not had such an encounter with a teacher. For context he is an Indian teacher, the class was relatively quiet only 6 students that day and I was the youngest female there. Thank you in advance."

yoga,Injured my arm but would still like to stretch and do yoga!!,"Hi all! The title says it all. I potentially tore a ligament in my arm/elbow (MRI to be done next week). I have a regular evening flow but it seems like every pose and transition I can think of would irritate my arm. 
Does anyone have any suggestions for easy yoga where I would not be weight bearing on my arm, or straightening my elbow? Thank you in advance!!"
yoga,Does it get easier ?,"Hello everyone ! I was hoping for some advice on my thoughts and dilemma right now. I’m a new yoga instructor (1 year) and despite being big on mindfulness, compassion and loving myself I’ve been super negative with the self talk and low on confidence. It’s been super hard to feel grounded in this beautiful part of my life. I love working and teaching classes however, it’s hard to find work in my city which has me feeling like maybe I should change paths. I know all good things take time, however I feel so unsteady and that’s such a scary feeling.   


So my question to you all is, seasoned yogi or not, **how long did it take for you to make this a full time profession or is it something don’t make full time but rather you have on the side.** Also, any advice on self confidence? When I teach I know I’m great, amazing even, but off the mat there’s this doubt of not being good enough and that’s why there are no opportunities available for me, which is an obsurd way of thinking, I know, but Im having trouble trying to contain those intrusive thoughts.   


I just feel so unstable and the idea of freelance and going from one studio to the next constantly doesn’t feel like a long term steady plan. Plus teaching certain styles of yoga that I’m not the most fond of (vinyasa &amp; hot yoga)  is making me disllike teaching. I’m more a yin, restorative, gentle yoga kind of person, but of course those aren’t the oppurtunities available.

Any advice ?"

yoga,Shaky &amp; nervousness when teaching,I absolutely love teaching but I find if I talk too much at first I start getting anxious.

yoga,Online Intermediate Yoga with Minimal Cues Help,"Hello! I have been practicing yoga at home for several years. We have small children and a busy family schedule so this is the best option. 

I have tried several streaming apps and yoga channels, but I notice that a lot of the videos are for beginners or the instructor talks throughout the practice (which takes away from the meditative part of the practice). 

I’m looking for an intermediate (spiritual) practice with less talking, minimal instruction, and more silence. I’ve tried Yoga with Kassandra and a few other popular YouTube channels, but it’s still not what I’m looking for. 

Does anyone have any streaming or YouTube suggestions? Looking for a spiritual vinyasa flow with consistency and more predictability. (If that makes sense). Not sure if there’s a term for what I’m looking for, so any suggestions would be appreciated!"

yoga,Yoga + Weak Adrenals?,"Hi all, I've been managing low adrenal output for nearly 10 years. I was totally nonfunctioning for a time and through a brain training program, I rebuilt my life. For about 4 yrs I had been on steroids for adrenal support and I've been able to wean off. I now support my adrenals using a circadian method of timing thyroid meds (I wake at 3 am, take the meds and fall back to sleep, this boosts adrenals naturally). 

I've tried Ashwagandha and found it hit or miss at boosting adrenal output. As for adrenal glandular products I resist taking them, because I figure what's the point of weaning off one med to start a new supplement? 

My goal is to eventually wean off all adrenal support entirely, since my adrenals do Work, it's just a matter of output (I'm open to any thoughts on this btw). Additionally, I also cut out very toxic ppl from my life (bye-bye family!) and as of now feel strong and amazing (yeah me!). 

Fast forward to the pandemic + yoga...I have been able to build yoga back into my life. But I find there is an adrenal ceiling. I use the Down Dog app and can do 30 min a day of Beginner 2 yoga. I may be able to gradually add in 1-2 days a week of Intermediate 1 OR do longer Beginner 2 sessions. I tried 2 days in a row of Intermediate 1 and my body said: No. So, I know I shouldn't do that back to back. All that said, this slow steady yoga has definitely made me stronger and I want to do MORE! But I also need to respect my body.

Questions are: 

Has anyone here ever fully recovered from low adrenal output? Got any directions or tips for me? 

Should I focus on adding Intermediate 1 a couple of times a week OR build up to longer sessions?

Thanks for weighing in."
yoga,Hip pain when doing crescent lunge,"Hi, i've been a casual yoga fan but lately i've been doing a challenge of doing 12 sun salutations every single day (been going for about a month). I do these, plus some other stretches like lizard, pigeon, some seated and lying positions, etc. In the last 3 or 4 sessions i've been experiencing an odd hip pain. It mainly is noticeable during crescent lunge. 

Previously when I did crescent lunge I would feel a nice, pleasant stretch along the top of my back leg. Now instead, I get a sharp pain in the front of my hip, again on the back leg. I'm not sure why it's suddenly uncomfortable. I am pretty sure my alignment is right. Should I stop doing this pose, or keep doing it, or take a break altogether to let my body adjust?

Same pain is also noticeable if I try and do a high kick (on the leg that is still standing)."

yoga,Shaking during poses,"Hello! 

I've been doing yoga for just over 6 months now. Morning and evening yoga, and I have grown quite flexible and comfortable in the poses. However, since the first day, I noticed that during certain poses like a wide-legged forward fold, my legs begin to shake. I've tried being more loose, thinking that it's because I was stretching my muscles out too much and that they were just too tight telling me to calm down. But, they still shake. I am unsure why but I was wondering if anyone has experienced this or if people have any tips on how to work around or with it, or, totally get past it?"

yoga,Is there a best way to warm up to Reclined Cow Face?,"I've been doing yoga, on and off from home, for two years and this is the only pose that regularly twinges something in my groin often with a couple of minutes' worth of pain to boot. I am definitely not forcing myself through the pain, what happens is that sometimes the twinge is instant, sudden and out of nowhere. Sometimes mid-pose and sometimes as soon as i get into the pose. I immediately stop and have to feel out the pain for a couple of minutes in what feels like my sartorius area.

Is there a pose set I can do to warm up to reclined cow face in the future? Would half cow face count as a warmup? Or should i just avoid this pose altogether? I'm not emotionally invested in it so I'm willing to accept all answers. I felt it best to reach out for opinions based on other's experience."

yoga,Poses/Routines that don't require standing,"Hi all! I've looked through past posts as well as the FAQ but couldn't really find any info on my particular situation. Essentially I have a condition where I can't stand for any length of time - feet and legs work, just excruciating pain in both feet, and I try to save that pain to completing what tasks I need to do during the day.

I'm really determined to start losing some weight, but so far the only resource I have for beginners yoga is DownDog which has a few non-standing routines. However, when searching for others (like chair-routines or disability-routines) they're modified in really odd ways that I can't tell what the correct pose is, and I don't want to do yoga in a chair 100% of the time.

I'm wondering if anyone knows any names or resources for specifically poses that don't require standing, but aren't limited to chair poses? I'm also quite nervous that because I can't do standing poses that I'm losing out on a lot, and it kills my motivation (I have a lot of guilt and self-blame when it comes to my disability).

yoga,Don't understand what I'm meant to feel in pigeon pose (beginner),"Hi all, I've been to a few yoga classes over the years, but recently started going out and practicing at home more often (\~3x week). I go to various studios with different instructors, and also trial different types of yoga, but one thing that seems to come up again and again is the [pigeon pose with forward fold](https://www.yogajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/yp_282_0141_fnl-sleeping-pigeon-pose-jason-crandell.jpg?width=730).

Let me preface this that at no point did an instructor claim that the front leg has to be parallel to the front of the mat, so this is not the issue.  
The issue is that I don't understand what I'm meant to be feeling. I definitely don't feel any glute stretch no matter the alignment of the leg or how far I bend over it. If I try to get the front leg bit more parallel to the mat then the inside of the hip on the front leg side gets this horrible pain which I can't describe (nerve pain maybe?) that prevents me from folding forward.

For reference seated lotus feels like a comfortable seating position and I never struggled with it - I see these two poses often thrown into the same category so it might be relevant."

The studios that are 30 mins away do not offer classes at times that work for my schedule other than on weekends.  If I could do virtual classes during the work week that would be ideal.

yoga,Practicing yoga with nerve damage.,"So, I’ve got chronic pelvic pain. More specifically, pudendal nerve damage (here’s [a link](https://images.app.goo.gl/oa9uBJNT9hCU6VVf7) showing the affected area… possibly NSFW just because you know, pelvic pain). The nerve pain is permanent and I’ve had it most of my life. It makes sitting very painful, but that’s pretty much the only thing that consistently hurts. In other words, I’m pretty terrible at knowing what will hurt me. Despite years and years of pelvic floor physical therapy. It’s ridiculous how inconsistent my triggers are. 

I restarted yoga in a class designed for people with chronic pain issues. It moves slowly and teaches you how to use props to accommodate different asanas. I was doing quite well and really enjoying myself. Until I injured myself in the nerve area pretty badly.

I’m not positive what did it. One class I went to had a ton of sitting poses, but my teacher helped me alter them so I wasn’t sitting so often or so directly on the nerve. I still didn’t feel great after that class. My next class was two days later, and that sent me over the edge. I could barely sit in my car and drive home. There’s a grocery store next to the yoga studio and I stopped in to get ice to sit on for the way back. It was bad

I’ve taken a week off and I’m feeling back to baseline, but now I’m scared. I don’t know how to prevent what happened at my yoga class from happening again. I don’t know want to stop doing yoga because I’m trying to make a point to my doctors that I’m not as disabled as they think I am. I’m being pressured into a surgery I don’t want, and I’m grasping at straws for things to do that may help loosen my pelvic floor and improve my mobility beyond regular pelvic floor PT. 

Should I give up on yoga? Or brace myself and try again? My teacher knows about my condition, but it’s not very common and *I’m* not even always sure what will hurt, so even though she’s wonderful, the struggle has continued. 

Is there maybe a specific type of yoga or class I should try? I’m more or less a beginner again.

(Just as a note, kegels are great for strengthening the pelvic floor but they are very bad for me since they further compress the pudendal nerve. I found one other post like mine when I searched on here and OP got bombarded with kegel recommendations lol. So just figured I’d get that out of the way.)"

yoga,Meditations and Yoga which specifically focus on channeling anger,"30 year old male who has been practicing mindfulness and meditation 'consistently enough' for the past year. While I have noticed a calming effect and benefit at times, overall I don't' think meditation or mindfulness is enough for me personally.

Reason being, I struggle with severe repressed anger based on a variety of issues which overlap. I have started to see a Psychotherapist and a Psychiatrist. My Psychotherapist has a very holistic approach which integrates the mind and the body. During our last session on Friday, she recommended that instead of a general meditative approach, I would be better served by focusing by some yoga/body/meditative moves which specifically focus on releasing anger.

***The 'Yoga Breath of Fire' in the morning, taking up boxing or buying myself a punchbag, pillow punching, and also this exercise involving taking a stance and moving the pelvis back and forth while releasing a noise at the same time (she couldn't think of the name, but demonstrated it to me during our last session and I took notes)....these are some suggestions she has given me.***

I definitely see the value in this approach and that it will fulfil the 'anger and lack of assertiveness' void. It makes total sense.

What I am looking for are other similar type exercises, meditations, yoga actions, which specifically focus on channeling anger."

My question is, (especially for any instructors in here), should I just say I don’t want to be adjusted and save her the misery? I don’t smell, Im just drenched in sweat, and don’t want her feeling obligated to touch me, or to then have to touch other people after me."

yoga,New Manduka Mat is Too Slippery,"Apologies if someone has posted this before, but I recently bought a new Manduka Pro mat after practicing on my cheap $20 mat for about 2 years. I figured since I do yoga consistently everyday it was time for an upgrade :)

The only problem is that because it is brand new, it is FAR too slippery for my practice! I think my palms sweat a lot in general, but it makes it very hard in downward dog/planking to hold myself up properly because my hands continue to slide forward no matter what I do. It's honestly lead to some wrist pain recently because the slipping is causing improper form and I crash into my wrists instead of evenly distributing weight. I never really had this problem (that I can remember) on my old mat.

I know Manduka has an anti-slip spray. Does it actually work? I feel like it honestly wouldn't do much. Most of the things I google simply recommend to ""practice more and it will wear down"", but I don't want to practice on a slippery mat and cause wrist injuries from improper form.

I'm even ok with ""messing it up"" a little bit if it means I can get back to practicing. I considered brushing it down with a Scrub Daddy because that's a little textured without being TOO hard because I obviously don't want to ruin the new mat.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated! :)"

I was going from a high plank to a downward dog pose and my thumb instantly started filling with pins and needles type pain and felt like it was going to explode.

yoga,Relationships and the business of Yoga,"I’ve been teaching yoga and other forms of movement as a gig for about 4 years now. About 7 months ago I started dating a woman who hasn’t ever been in the business. This is all probably my own fault for doing this once I figured out she has a jealous streak, but when she needed work I connected her with my boss and she now works as desk staff/concierge at the same studio where I teach. At least once a week there’s a new problem with her feeling like a female student is being too chatty with me. Daily Questions about who I find attractive, who I’ve dated in the studio, if I really needed to spend time answering questions after class, “why can’t people just take their class and go,” etc. It’s to the point where I got a notification on my IG that a student my girlfriend decided she doesn’t like started following me on Instagram after the studio reposted some of my content and it made me anxious. 
I’ve been a good boyfriend. A good partner. I go to her chemo sessions with her. I paid for her YTT because she was interested in becoming a teacher. We’re working on finding a space with enough room for us and her son. She has no reason to act as if I’m this cheating dog. 

Don’t know if I’m looking for advice as just venting."
yoga,Is it possible to reverse scoliosis through yoga?,"This may be more of a question for a physician but I would like to hear from the yoga community. I was born with mild scoliosis, it curves straight out from my back (not left or right), I have worked on it via weight lifting and stretching and that for the most part has been manageable for me. 

Now I have a desk job that requires lots of sitting, I'm afraid this will make it worse with time. Does anyone here have any experience treating or even better reversing scoliosis?

**Bonus question:** any back strengthening/mobility routines you recommend for such a job? I run a lot and also have anterior pelvic tilt, both are areas that I should focus on.

yoga,Discussion about Fear Mongering cues,"I just wanted to post this to start a discussion. I have been teaching at a studio for a little while and as new students roll in I have noticed that so many of them don’t do up dog. I asked a student one day and she said that no one else at the studio teaches it because it causes injury to the lower back. Now all postures can cause injury if done incorrectly but I was shocked that even the strongest students at the studio skip chaturanga and up dog all because the teachers keep telling them it’s unsafe.

A large majority of my students also bend their knees in triangle and pyramid and again, when I inquired about it, a student told me that if they don’t bend their knee it will hyperextend and cause injury. Again, not saying this makes their practice wrong but it definitely limits the amount of muscle activation you can get in the front leg and they can get more out of the postures with a strait leg.

I keep having instances like this where it seems like students are hearing things in class that are causing a lot of fear, when the majority of them do not need to worry about these injuries. I think we need to remember as teachers that it is important to think about the words we choose to use and who they apply to. I find it happens easily when teachers cue an entire room for a correction that really only applies to one student and now the other 24 people in the room are now overcompensating when they really didn’t need to adjust anything. It’s also important to remember that not every cue we learn in teacher training applies to every class. I am by no means a perfect teacher, but I thought this might be an interesting topic I haven’t really seen on here . Sorry for the rambling and maybe I am alone in this but I would love to hear some thoughts."
yoga,I know nothing about yoga but I think it can help me (back and core),"Hello yoga folks. I took a labourer job a few weeks ago and I lift lots of things. Every day I wake up feeling stiff, and by the end of the shift I feel the fatigue in my spimal column. I am using proper technique when I can! But 40 hours of moving 50lb boxes can take a toll on anyone. I'm lanky and not exactly built like a truck.

All I know about yoga is that it sometimes focuses on core strength and stabilizer muscles; beyond sit ups I don't really know how to target that stuff and I'm a little too busy to be looking at YouTube all day.

Is there something I can do to target my core and stabilizer stuff and help me support my back? Or where should I look to find good resources that respect a fella's time?

Any help is deeply appreciated.
P.S. I'm thinking about looking into yoga for some gentle exercise amyway but that really is a lower priority concern at the moment 😅"
yoga,True Story,"I was up late one night recently and decided to meditate, so I went to what I call my magic carpet and began my flight. After a while I was surprised to find that I had a passenger, which was a small toad that must have come in through the front door while I was outside, and hopped up right in front of me as I sat in meditation. I was surprised by the unexpected visit, but what surprised me even more was that the toad remained perfectly calm and still while I covered it with a rag, picked it up, and took it back outside. And as I walked back inside, all I  could think was I'll bet that blew his mind. If I could meme, that toad would be sitting on a mushroom telling his buddies,  I've been with gods and lived."

But I want to start weight training and doing yoga from home. My goal is to build a strong injury free body. My main goal is to build my OWN yoga practice from yoga and get into stretches and poses that feel comfortable for MY body. 

Anyone here do this as well ?"
yoga,"What to do after an ""off"" day","Hey everyone! I've been diligently practicing at a hot yoga studio for about two months now a few times a week. Every time I have gone, while I am not able to do the most advanced poses and am nowhere nearly as flexible as most of the class, I have been able to keep up in class and I come out of class feeling great. 

This weekend, I attempted a Yoga with Adriene video and struggled greatly. I mostly wrote it off as not being able to concentrate as well as I am when I'm in the studio and not having others around me to motivate me. Today, however, I struggled badly again, but this time in the studio. I fell out of almost every pose, the bottoms of my feet felt very strained, and I simply felt like I could not go on several times throughout the hour-long class. While I made it through the class, I left feeling so defeated and have been feeling drained ever since. During class, I became very self-conscious and even had this mid-class vision of the instructor coming up to me after class and recommending that I only do beginner classes from here on out (of course that did not actually happen). 

I guess I just want to know what you guys do when you feel ""off track"" like this. I plan on going for a brisk walk tomorrow instead of attending class and am hoping that will shake it off, but yeah. Why am I suddenly struggling so hard and how do I overcome?"

It’s painful to even attempt to enter the pose and I bruise easily so I end up with marks where my my legs touch the back of my arms.

yoga,Anti-vax tirade mid class,Today I went to my studio and had an instructor that I don’t normally take. She’s very chatty during class and is sort of a loud person in general. She had a whole Eric Clapton playlist and like 20 minutes into class started going off on how the vaccine is poison and paralyzed the greatest guitar player that’s ever existed and how her father died of Covid and on his death bed was saying he should have gotten the vaccine but she told him that she was glad he didn’t get it because it’s not what he wanted. Anyway it was uncomfortable AF and made me so upset during my practice that the practice itself seems like a waste. It was literally like half the practice long. I sort of want to complain but feel like it will be awkward at the studio then. I can try to just avoid her classes but I’m so bummed out about this.

yoga,Should a yoga teacher push down on you while you’re in a pose?,"I’m in yoga teacher training, and last class we were learning how to do adjustments. The teacher taught us how to push down on peoples hips while they’re in child’s pose (I’ve never heard of this before) and also to push down along the back, and also how to push down in between peoples shoulder blades while in downward dog.

The teacher used me as an example and practiced these “adjustments” on me. It felt really forceful and honestly didn’t feel that great for my body. And when the other student practiced on me  she used even more force… I did let her know it was way too hard.

Two days later I’m extremely sore, especially my back… I’m wondering if anyone has ever heard of yoga teachers pushing down on students while they’re in a pose, specifically downward dog and child’s?

yoga,how can I deepen my practice?,"Hello reddit yogis. Prior to covid, I had a pretty regular home practice, but remote work, remote school, at home everything, etc killed it for me. Now when I attempt yoga at home, I feel like I have some portion of my attention on everything else that's happening in the house (husband, kids, pets). 

It's time for a kick start, so I've signed up for some studio classes to get me going. I'm curious, though... I feel like the studio yoga I've experienced doesn't do much beyond asanas... It's like I'm going through the motions and the focus of the class is more on fitness rather than growth, patience, etc

I've looked into YTT, but I don't feel like it's for me, so what suggestions do you all have for how I can pursue my goals? Is there a type of class I can look for? Are there things I can add for myself to a studio class for my own personal growth in those areas? 

A few notes: I'm in the US, but not in a big city, so studio options are greatly limited. I still work from home full time, but I have trouble pulling myself away for breaks (something else I'm practicing lol)

I just got my first case of yoga butt. I have pain deep in my left sit bone. I can tell it’s starting in the hamstring.

I’ve been reading that it’s often a hamstring strength issue, but I believe mine is just from overly flexible hamstrings? 

I’m  quite strong, and have overly developed hamstrings which is why I believe I can go deep - forehead to shin, hands flat on floor etc

I recently ramped up my yoga practice. If it’s over used and being open, what is my best course of fast healing and recovery?

yoga,Help interpreting instructor's comment,"Several times during hot yoga this morning my body was telling me to take a shavasana- so I did.  While walking out the instructor said ""Your back should be nice and limber Matt"".

How should I be interpreting that comment?"
yoga,Do females mind when a male goes shirtless in hot yoga?,"Hello!

I go to a heated vinyasa studio 5-6 times per week and I almost always practice shirtless. Does anyone ever mind this? It's truly just a comfort thing and I find a sweaty shirt sticking and hanging is pretty distracting for me.

I just want to be courteous and hate that it may bother someone...not that anything has really happened or been said to me yet but I'd rather try and avoid it alltogether."
yoga,"Downward dog, of course...","OK, I know everyone always says it doesn't matter if our feet are in the air or touching the mat, if we're a beginner... but, I've been doing yoga one and off for some 4 years now and still I can never really do it properly (the way teachers do it : feet on the mat, perfect triangle shape of the body).

Is this common? I simply feel like my whole body will burst if I raise my butt any higher and try to touch the mat with feet.
Also, my wrists hurt often, but I think that's common for me in similar poses too.

Has anyone had a similar situation?"
yoga,Advice please: Yoga teacher looking to further and deepen career in wellness,"I am a 200hr certified yoga teacher and I have a 250hr aerial  yoga certification

With that said, I'm looking for something to further my career and make things more stable and meaningful for me. Something tangible and hands on 

Yoga teachers, what have you explored 

  
Ideas I have.. 

\*\*\*Integrative Somatic Trauma Therapy Certificate

\*\*\*Cupping (preferably a certification without needing to be a licensed massage therapist) 

Do these seem worthwhile?   


Thanks for your help and input."
yoga,Yoga book recommendations please!,"I’m fairly new to yoga. I’ve been doing video lead home practice on and off for a couple of years. I’ve not yet managed to go to in person classes yet because of Covid and my own personal insecurities. 

I am very much interested in making yoga my career over the next 5 years. Can anyone recommend any yoga books that might help with the progression to teaching as well as books that will help me better understand the spiritual side of yoga? 

Basically anything that will help me further my knowledge of yoga both on and off the mat. 

Thank you!"
yoga,Yoga and physical fitness,I'm curious what everyone does for physical exercise. Do you just do yoga? Supplement with other exercise? Do you use yoga as a supplement to your other workouts?
yoga,Experiencing the shadow,"I (M50) just started practicing yoga. In fact calling it a practice is a little premature. It’s only been 5 days.  I’m using Iyengar’s “The Concise Light on Yoga”. 

The last couple of days I’ve been experiencing some unpleasant aspects of myself—emotionally laden animosity toward the people around me. I think it’s an awareness of my shadow. This is not completely out of the blue but has an unexpected intensity. 

I’m wondering if this is an effect of the yoga or if it’s just coincidence.  Is it an indicator that I’m doing it right, or wrong?  Should I stop, or keep going?  I’m not particularly in the mood for an emotion upheaval right now, but I acknowledge that embracing the shadow is an important part of the journey to wholeness."

yoga,Very overwhelmed by 50 hour corepower yoga sculpt course?,"I started yoga maybe 5 months ago and am doing the 50 hour teacher training.

This course is insane. I dont know much about yoga and they expect me to learn integration, sun a, sun b in a day and do it to their exact formula.

I work full time and in my opinion this takes 100 hours of study alone to even fully understand their course and formula. 

I HATE going to training because I dont have the time to study and theres no way im leading a slow and flow with 1 day of lecture?!? They teach something for 30 minutes and expect us to do it? Then obviously i dont know what the f*** im doing and they come over to “help” i dont need help i need time to study and learn. 

I actually had to leave early because I started having a panic attack.

Yogis - is this normal for teacher training? I may drop out but I already paid. Thanks"
yoga,Back pain ?,If I lay flat on my stomach I feel a little back pain in what I believe is the SI Joint. It feels like it needs to pop but I can’t do anything to relieve it? What do you think can be going on?
yoga,How often to practice a pose?,"So I’ve been getting into a daily routine. I would still consider myself a beginner, though I can already see some progress. If I wanted to get better at a pose, say Uttanasana, how often should I practice it? Do I run risk of injury if I wake up and hold the pose for 10 breaths before I start my day? Or maybe end my day by holding the pose? Is it good or bad to work on poses outside of my practice?"
yoga,Is there a point in doing the Bikram/Hot Yoga Flow (26/2) without heat?,"Hi Yogis,

I have been doing mainly Hatha Vinyasas and Power Yoga routines for a while now but I feel like it would be good to do something different.

I was wondering if there is a point in doing the Bikram/Hot Yoga without the heat, is the 90 minute routine going to be too easy and basically pointless compared to a Hatha/Power Yoga Flow? Have any of you done it before?

Thank you for all the answers!"

yoga,"Videos on YT to help with hip, glute, and hamstring tightness","Howdy y'all, I've never done yoga and am looking to start. Classes aren't an option for me so I'm trying to find some videos on YouTube to get started.

My main goals are relieving the massive tightness in my hips, glutes, and hamstrings. I have a duck foot on my right side, and potentially pelvic tilt but I am waiting to see a doctor and hopefully physical therapist to figure out what is wrong with it and what it needs to be done.

In the mean time, does anyone have any links to videos on YouTube they could share to help me out? Thanks y'all?"
yoga,Pose name?,"Sorry for this weird question, but there was a pose my instructor had us do that was really cool and I’d like to get better at. I cannot remember the name she said it was during the practice, and was too sleep deprived to remember to ask her at the end of it.


Essentially, from toe squat, we placed both our palms flat on the mat to one side of our knees, pointed perpendicularly away from the direction of the knees. Then, we put tipped our weight into our elbows (one elbow against a thigh, one against a hip) and floated our feet off of the mat. No idea if that makes sense. Thank you, kindly."
yoga,I've been teaching two years online... Need advice,"Teaching online works really well for me due to working full time and teaching part time. I love it. However, I've found it has been more difficult to advertise and encourage new people into the class. Do you have any tips for getting people to come along and try your online classes? I do teach in-person too."
yoga,"Injured finger, please help me find yoga practices that don't require putting weight on the hands","Hello! Earlier this year I decided I would do yoga every day. I'm currently on day 121 and I hurt my finger. The doc said it takes 6-8 weeks to heal and to not put too much pressure on it for the first 4. So no planks, down dogs etc. I'm going to continue doing yoga, so I need something lower body focused.

I've been mostly doing yoga with Breathe and Flow and have their patreon with lots of long Yin classes. But if any of you know any good online classes I would really appreciate if you shared them, I don't want to do 8 weeks of just yin yoga. I am willing to do the same few classes over and over if that's what it takes, but some variety would not hurt.

Thank you guys and have an awesome day where ever you are!"

yoga,hyperpigmentation and hot yoga,"I got a facial done yesterday, mainly to target hyperpigmentation and fine lines. And I learned that hot yoga can make hyperpigmentation worse (hot yoga, saunas, steam rooms) Pretty much any exposure to heat can make it worse.  

I love hot yoga and do it about 3 - 4x per week and I'm not going to give it up.  The aesthetician advised me to remove all actives (i.e. moisturizers with retinol, serums, etc. ) and go to practice with a clean face and sunscreen only to decrease the chances of my hyperpigmentation of becoming worse.  

Not sure if this is common knowledge but it wasn't for me, so I hope this info helps fellow yogis that share my concerns."
yoga,Advice for a new teacher?,"I'm finally getting my start after graduating a great 200 hour teaching certification program. I'm teaching every Sunday for at least the rest of the summer. Its all for charity and to raise money for the local human society. I'm taking the time to get experience and learn before pursue doing it as a real job. 

To that end, I'd really appreciate getting any and all advice and feedback. Both from a teachers and especially from a students perspective. What do you like to see in a teacher? What do you feel like you need to see to facilitate a good practice for yourself and others? 

Thank you so much! Namaste &lt;3"

yoga,Does anyone else find happy baby so difficult?,"I gain flexibility pretty quickly in a lot of my body besides my hips/lower back where I am really struggling to get any kind of flexibility with Happy Baby.  


My lower body always curls up and I can't get a flat back and my legs can't come down enough. Has anyone else had similar experiences? how long did it take you to overcome it?

yoga,How can I get DownDog be less repetitive?,"I really love the app, and have been using it for 2 years now, but nowadays it has become so repetitive that it borders on tiresome. Sometimes I have to generate the same session 3-5 times before it offers any variety within the asanas. I've also noticed even on the advanced level, it rarely offers any really difficult or complex asanas - ot just levels off at, say, the Eight-point hold. 
Is it because of the nature of the app? Or is it just the algorith being stupid? If I delete my history, will it reset itself (and will I lose my favourites)?"
yoga,Yin Yoga For Someone With A Janky Wrist (aka One That Can't Bear Weight)?,"Basically as the title says. My left wrist can't bear or carry weight especially if it involves forwards pressure (forearm over beyond vertical towards the finger) or leaning outwards, but I still want to do yoga. I really liked yin yoga when I tried it ages ago and it allows for more support, so I was hoping people could suggest some good yin yoga channels. It would be a Bonus it if provides modification to plus size people.

yoga,recently discovered passion for yoga,"Hi all

40Y.M. 

I've through tough times. Sickness in my parents and my kids. Financial burden. Work burn out. You know ... the works. Admittedly, I was borderline suicidal. I dunno what prompted me to fire up an online video for yoga and I practiced along. The feeling ... the sensation. I literally felt a space has been created in my mind. I am totally sold. I've felt a sensation of joy ... long forgotten. No drugs needed. It did not solve my problems ... yet it put me in a better place ... May be 10% .. but I will take that over nothing. 

 I started telling everybody around me with a sparkly eyes... I felt everybody should and must know this. 

What I've noticed so far in me:

1. I do not want the class to end. 
2. When I do not do it ... My mind craves it. 
3. I do not crave my addictions on the days I am on it. 

Are these observations just a transient beginner's thing and it's gonna fade away? Or this is what it's all about? This is what yoga supposed to make you feel?  Any recommendations from yoga veterans?"
yoga,"Online yoga classes/courses with more spiritual/meditation elements? (Also, has anyone tried Kassandra's app?)","Hi all,  

I try to do Yoga with Kassandra every other day or so, and generally go for a Vinyasa video but my mind tends to wander and I don't really feel I'm getting the mental benefits that people often talk about with yoga.  I think I need to be pushed to be a bit more mindful and was thinking it could be nice to do some classes where that is an explicit focus.

I tried some of her Yin classes with affirmations on Youtube and I really enjoyed them.  

I notice Kassandra has an app where she offers some kind of monthly yoga course that involves a lot of intention setting etc. (she bases it around the Lunar cycle, I think.)  I thought I might give it a try as I really like her practices in general and I thought it could be a nice way to get more into the meditation side of things etc.  

Just wondering if anybody else has tried it, or if I should look into other options before jumping straight into this specific app?

Going to an in-person class isn't really an option for me so I'd like to try and find something that I'm able to do from home.

(Also, it should go without saying but please keep your comments about online yoga instructors respectful on this post.  I know that everyone has their own preferences and some people are weirded out by more spiritual approaches etc., but when I was looking this topic up in the subreddit I came across some pretty judgmental/inappropriate comments.)"
yoga,"Book recs - intersectional, feminist, non-problematic gurus?","Hi! I love yoga and practice daily, and it has enriched my life deeply, but I'm trying to ground my yoga practice in more authenticity and intersectionality by educating myself more. I am struggling to find a comprehensive book on yoga and its history by a yoga teacher that isn't a) a white woman or b)an Indian guru who has a history of sexual abuse or abuse of power of some sort. Those are unfortunately the most common demographics of authors/gurus that I can find. Ideally, I'd love some Indian women/feminist approaches to yoga, but a comprehensive book by a reputable male Indian guru without a history of abuse would be great too. Thank you all so much!!!"
yoga,I cry every time I do yoga,"Hello fellow yogis and mediators.

I do about 1 hour of vinyassa yoga a day including some meditation and breath work.

I cry anywhere from a few tears to a full on meltdown every time.

I'm currently healing from some trauma (childhood and family trauma) and have moved abroad to a better place.

I'm sure this is food for me but I wonder if it's normal to cry every time and to feel deep sadness and hurt. Will I ever be able to meditate and feel joy instead? 

Much love ❤"

yoga,Where should I sell yoga items? Poshmark?,"Sorry in advance for all these random thoughts. Grateful for any help! I've been doing hot yoga, mainly vinyasa, for almost a year now, and have just been using my Lululemon 5mm reversible mat with no towel. It has worked amazing, but now I wanted to start using a towel as it's been a little harder to grip during class. 

I bought the yogitoes towel by Manduka in extra long length (79 inches). The extra length over my mat kinda bothers me. I can tuck it over and it remains secure, I honestly just keep thinking how I wanted the eQua mat originally which would have fit better. For reference, I bought it from my yoga studio, where my teacher told me to get yogitoes for the grip feature over the eQua, and the only yogitoes that was available there was the extra long length. 

I was thinking of trying to sell the yogitoes one, but not sure where is the best place to sell yoga items. I haven't actually used it aside from just trying light yoga with it to see how it works with my mat. 

Do you guys think I should just keep trying with it? I could tuck it under my mat and it is pretty secure, just a little annoying. I can't tell if I should just stick with this, or get the eQua mat if I can sell this, or get both even though its expensive?"

yoga,How to combine weight lifting and yoga?,"If I want to do both, go to the gym, build muscle and lift but also want to do yoga for recovery, wellbeing and flexibility. How should I go about it?

Should I alternate days, 1 day gym and 1 day yoga or should I do gym in the mornings and yoga in the evenings? Strength in the morning and flexibility in the evening sounds pretty good but will it work? Maybe it's better to do yoga first and then gym? Or maybe it's better to split the week, start with 3 days gym then 3 days yoga and 1 day off.

Maybe I should do yoga purely for recovery and do more yin yoga and less of the physically demanding yoga...

If I were fully fit, all this probably wouldn't be an issue and I could do both every day, but I'm not there yet. Still a beginner at both."
yoga,I miss yoga,"So I've been doing yoga on and off for a couple of months. Never found the motivation to really get into it even though I've wanted to for a long while. 

And in the beginning of June, I'd finally found my motivation. I was doing yoga almost every day (some days I had to listen to my body and take a day off). 

Then last Friday, on June 10th, I got an IUD. Suffice to say that I've been in extreme pain for the last week and couldn't even stay upright, so yoga was out of the question. 

I'm gonna try to get the IUD removed tonight because of all my symptoms and I just CANNOT wait to start yoga again. I've been feeling so restless and like a slug. 

Yoga has always left me feeling so fresh, proud of myself and ready for the day. I miss that feeling. I miss the stretch. I miss that time of the day where I can just focus on me, my body and my breath. It always feels like a gift. 

Getting on the mat in the morning is a challenge, but once I'm there, I don't want to leave it. I do Yoga with Adriene and once the video is over, I always want to do one more. It feels like they go by so fast. 

I'm still very much a beginner and holding poses takes a lot of energy and determination on my part, but I can't wait to be further along and able to hold poses better. To be able to really sink into the practice without wondering if my neck position is correct, am I breathing right, etc. because my body will be so used to the movements. 

I can't wait to have my body again and to be able to do yoga. I'm vibrating in anticipation."
yoga,Yoga and mental health,"Unqualified opinion here, but yoga is startlingly effective for a wide range of mental health problems, not only anxiety and depression.

Yoga has also been seen to alleviate many of the problems associated with schizophrenia, including ""hearing voices,"" and kundalini yoga is now being taught alongside CBT as an adjunct: this is called CBT+Y or CBT+Yoga.

Many schizophrenics, oddly, hear specifically that ""kundalini yoga is a secret,"" which a) it's not and b) is an oddly specific thing to hear, especially considering how effective it is in battling schizophrenia."

yoga,Unexpected Benefits,"Just curious what some of the unexpected benefits of beginning your practice have been? Yes, I have gained improved flexibility and mental clarity, but at almost 40 I can now twerk (to the dismay of my children and the delight of my husband) after believing my body just “didn’t move that way”.

I know I should put a folded up blanket or towel under the back of my head, but how do I know how high the blanket/towel should be?

yoga,Little progress post: yoga and strength training (excellent combo) and a shoutout to another series I was linked to,"I recently brought my yogic practice around again, and have been consistently doing it for the past 4 months or so.  Most of this was doing a short chair routine as I started VERY obese and inflexible.  Recently I started doing a YWA relaxation vid in the evenings, but I was steered toward Fightmaster's beginning yoga series, and it's the first time I've REALLY learned a lot about basic poses.  I can't recommend it enough for a beginner.  I'm on day 4 and loving every minute.  


On my first point, I have had some shoulder issues that I've been working through.  When I would lay on my back, I had to kind of bend my elbow and let gravity help me out when I extended my arms out wise in different poses   It hurt and I was starting tog et worried. I started a lifting routine this past week (Stronglifts 5X5) and while I totally believe yoga built this foundation, after a good second session involving some barbell rows, I went into a twist/arm stretch and my shoulder stayed FIRMLY on the ground as my arm went out with FAR more range of movement that I've ever had in that stretch.  


I don't think I built muscle after that session, and that the weight pulled something out that was incorrectly in, but it just showed me how important lifting is!  


tl;dr: Fightmaster's beginner series is awesome, and lifting helped me with some shoulder issues  


Thanks for reading?  Namaste."

yoga,my yoga esperience,"Hello,

i just whanted to share my experience with doing yogaasanas regulary. I started doing yoga in september 21 after buying ""Light on Yoga"" from iyengar and used this book as a guide. In november 21 i started doing it daily from 20 minutes to now 30-40 minutes. Some days i rest. Iam really proud of this achievement and my progress so far.I started doing it for mental benefits. I suffered from anxiety and light depressions for years and tryed a lot of stuff to help me. But doing yoga daily is really the gamechanger for me. I cant describe how thankfull iam.

For me its like a lightswitch. After i do it iam so blissed and all the negative things in my brain are gone. Furthermore i feel so great! so light, relaxed and happy! Its like i can manipulate myself. I just have to do it every day and i promised myself to do it fot the rest of my life. Its like the cure i was looking for, but even better because it not only cures like medicine, but also improves my life overall in well beeing and other aspects.

Its not easy to motivate me every day, but it helps to imagine the benefits and still do it on bad days. It gets easyser the longer iam on my journey.

Just wanted to share this and thank you all for making this subreddit so inspiring! Have a nice day!"
yoga,JKYog International Festival of Yoga,Some good speakers at this year's [JKYog International Festival of Yoga](https://www.jkyog.org/international-festival-of-yoga).
yoga,"Different ""ways"" of realising the Truth","I came across a B.K.S. Iyengar quote in a post here: ""There is only one reality, but there are many ways that reality can be interpreted"". This is not the first time I have heard this quote. For example, Ma Sarada Devi (circa late 19th CE) had also quoted this.

I'm wondering if anyone knows whether Iyengar was talking in the context of different ways to realise the ultimate Truth, that is, Brahman? It sounded to me like he did considering he says ""There is only one reality"".

There have been various commentaries on the Upanishads and I have always wondered how they have all differed from each other and branched out into various schools of thought.

Advaita Vedanta, Vishishtadvaita and Sankhya / Yoga differ amongst each other, on the most fundamental aspects, such as the relationship between the Atman, the material world (Maya) and Brahman.

Can they be seen as ""different ways"" to reach the same understanding / reality in the way B.K.S. Iyengar (and other enlightened people) had said? Or I'm curious if there is a ""right"" or ""wrong"" approach to look at the Upanishads, given that there are 6 distinct branches of thought stemming from the body of the Vedas (if I'm not wrong). I understand that there are ""flaws"" in a given system of thought, and perhaps that is why there had been so many different takes on the Upanishads?

Maybe they are different perspectives on the same Truth and they are all valid ways to look at it?

I personally like many aspects of Advaita Vedanta, and Adi Shankaracharya's viewpoint does make a lot of sense to me, which is that everything is just One reality, but so does the Yoga (Sankhya) viewpoint, in the sense that the stilling of the mind leads you to the Truth, where the Seer abides in it's own nature, as opposed to the path of Jnana Yoga, or knowledge (in the Advaitic perspective).

What would be a good way to approach / look at the differences in the interpretations of the Upanishads? Can they be seen as different perspectives to realise the same Truth? Or is it that, some perspectives lead you to a ""truer"" Truth which is better than others?"
yoga,I had a week off of yoga due to pneumonia and I'm now really stiff and sore.,"So I got really sick, I pushed through for a week then had antibiotics and had to take over a week off. Previously I was doing 1hr a day of yoga in cycles of power, yin, hatha. I've been doing this for nearly 3 years. Now I'm trying to start again and I can only manage 30 mins due to muscle weakness, and then I have to have a rest day because I'm SO stiff and sore after. I usually do yin or meditation on 'rest' days but I can't even manage that. Has anybody been through this and can give me any advice?  I use an app so I don't have a teacher I can ask."

I go to my yoga studio daily so I’m still getting in my practice. If I do practice outside it has to be under a spot of shade. It’s frustrating bc I feel like so much of the culture around yoga involves practicing outside, feeling the beams of sunlight against your skin, and most retreats spend time outdoors/beaches (they’re literally called SUN salutations for godsake lol). I wanted to do one of those retreat-style teacher trainings in another country like Peru or in Bali, but I see photos of their students practicing under the sun and I just :|.

yoga,Spinal Twists without muscle engagement- dangerous? (Yoga and back health),"During my teacher training, a British woman (not sure if it is relevant that she's british but anyway) who was doing the anatomy portion of our training expressed caution around spinal twists where the muscles around the spine are not active. The beloved reclined spinal twist at the end of class,  for example.      I could see she was hesitant to express this caution though (probably because the spinal twist at the end of class is so popular) and I have thought about it ever since. MANY people (esp men I've noticed) have low back pain, and sometimes are discouraged from yoga because they think it doesn't help or God forbid: it makes it worse. I'm wondering if there are more controversial poses such as this we (teachers) can all tweak in sequences to make better.. IE better protect discs, etc. I'm not a doctor (yet? haha) so don't have the knowledge to see whether I'm (really she) is right on this.

yoga,Yoga pants for a sweaty man?,"I sweat with anything over 60 degrees.
So, of course, I got into bikram.

I'm looking for compression pants because I figured that this would be the best thing to minimize the stream of sweat that currently emanates from me during my sessions (I'm using sweatpants, of all things). 

Are there any compression pants/leggings specifically for (sweaty) men that I should look out for or am I over thinking this?"
yoga,Where to go from here?,"Right now I'm a bit of a ""slightly experienced beginner"".  I've been doing yoga for about 5 months now getting in shape since my body was starting to feel a bit cramped.  I started with Breathe and Flow's Embark and Ignite programs and even redid them a couple times.  I really liked that the programs implemented breathing and meditation at the end, since I'm awful at managing myself and struggle to, for example, do a relatively intense video and then still have the willpower at the end to look up another video for breathing exercises or meditation.

Right now I have a goal to achieve several poses, wheel pose (achieved!) Forward bend with flat hands on the floor (achieved!), Lotus pose (working on it), tortoise pose (longer term goal), and both types of splits (haven't even worked on this yet!). This has helped keep me motivated in my daily practice but I crave something more structured, since the overall structure of those programs was very helpful.  I really liked having relaxing/resting days baked in as well as the breathing exercises/meditation at the end of every session."

I can even provide proof of original purchases on all mats except the Classic Black if requested.

yoga,Sharing some of my favorite yoga quotes,"  

**B.K.S. Iyengar,** **Light on Life is such a good book, what about you guys? Do you have any good yoga book recommendations or quotes? :-)**

“Yoga does not just change the way we see things, it transforms the person who sees.”  
 ― **B.K.S. Iyengar,** **Light on Life**

“You must purge yourself before finding faults in others. When you see a mistake in somebody else, try to find if you are making the same mistake. This is the way to take judgment and to turn it into improvement. Do not look at others' bodies with envy or with superiority. All people are born with different constitutions. Never compare with others. Each one's capacities are a function of his or her internal strength. Know your capacities and continually improve upon them.” **― B.K.S. Iyengar, Light on Life**

“There is no progress toward ultimate freedom without transformation, and this is the key issue in all lives.” ― **B.K.S. Iyengar, Light on Life**

“There is only one reality, but there are many ways that reality can be interpreted.”  
 ― **B.K.S. Iyengar,** **Light on Life**

Yoga allows you to find a new kind of freedom that you may not have known even existed.”  
 ― **B.K.S. Iyengar,** **Light on Life**

“Yoga allows you to rediscover a sense of wholeness in your life, where you do not feel like you are constantly trying to fit broken pieces together.” ― **B.K.S. Iyengar, Light on Life**"

yoga,Questions from a beginner,"I started yoga by doing the 30 day yoga challenge by Adriene (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-Uzyp5P3Vcuv5qCHQOC8W6grN) and I’m currently on day 22 and I have some questions.

1: When doing a pose, like downward dog, when I can’t do the pose perfectly yet, like my legs aren’t straight, should my goal be to always feel the stretch of the bent area or should I do what I can and then over time will I be able to do it perfectly?

2: I know you have to move with your breath and the instructor in the video always say that you should do a move with your inhale or exhale and she really guides you on how to breath. But sometimes my breath isn’t in line with hers because I get out of breath or it feels like I can’t take as big a breath as she is. So is it okay if I can’t always move with my breath or is that something I should work on, and if so, how can I improve it.

3: I have noticed that my limbs aren’t always in line and straight when doing certain poses or it just doesn’t feel straight but it looks fine. I do try and check in and correct it when I can but it always feel like my feet aren’t in the right position or my hands aren’t under my shoulders. How can I improve this?"
yoga,Iyengar Yoga Subscription,I'm super new to yoga and I've been practicing for about 2 months. I've been using FWFG but I'm finding it does not really match my personality. I've been really drawn to Iyengar  yoga but unfortunately there are no local teachers. Is there a subscription you would recommend for Iyengar yoga? Thanks.
yoga,please recommend audiobooks on proper authentic pranayama,"There is so much info out there these days it's hard to know what is the best source.  I have practiced pranayama mostly based on a combination of YouTube videos and the sivananda guide to yoga I've had since I was a child.  The sivananda guide seemed pretty authentic from what I can tell. 

When I say authenticity I'm not meaning it has to be an Indian person or Hindu but more that it is proper technique and is connected to the original techniques of pranayama from 100s or thousands of years ago , and not done improperly. 

I have made progress in switching from chest to belly breathing but I'm also learning that belly breathing is better than chest breathing but isn't the end goal and that proper diaphragmatic breathing is different from just filling your belly and letting it protrude. 
I'm kinda freaking out.  My pranayama practice has helped me a lot , it's basically the only part of yoga I can do since I'm bedbound and a lot of fusion surgery stuff prevents me from doing many of the bendy things things if I wasn't bedbound. I don't want to think I've been doing this all for nothing.  I do hope that having switched away from hyperventilation and chest breathing to belly breathing and doing the other parts of slow pranayama hasn't been worthless, since it seems to have helped me a lot with relaxation and bp, but I want to master subtleties of diaphragmatic breathing too. 

I have eye issues where I can't look at anything especially videos for too long but I can look briefly so if there is a short video that's important I'll watch it. However this is why I'm asking specifically for audiobooks or podcasts 

Since I can look at things briefly non confusing diagrams for diaphragmatic breathing and what not to do would be helpful too.  But the ideal thing is a book on pranayama that is thorough and an audiobook. 

Or a podcast. 
I just don't know how to wade through all the material and find the helpful stuff."
yoga,Broke my toe in practice today. Not upset about to toe…pretty upset I’m not going to be able to practice for a while.,"Got a little excited while doing a handstand. Transitioned into chaturanga and smacked my big toe into the ground. Broken. 

Not too upset about the toe but I’m sad I won’t be able to see my fellow yogis and practice for a while. Anything I can work on in the meantime? Breath work? Poses?"
yoga,Not entirely sure where to go from here in terms of progressing,"I never really took yoga seriously when I started to do it a bit many years ago.  I have been doing a short chair routine with a few auxiliary movements for the past 4 months.  It is a great little routine to clear the head and stretch out the neck and back; important things for someone who is constantly on the computer.  


I recently (about  a month ago) added in [this routine](https://youtu.be/v7SN-d4qXx0) into my daily schedule; it's one I've been doing for a long time and am quite familiar with.  I want to try maybe some more active 30 minute routines, but there are a few obstacles.  For one, I am severely obese (though losing weight at a steady rate) and out of shape in my cardio systems, and am quite weak.  Second, yoga is a spiritual practice for me (having embraced meditation and some spirituality in the past few years), and I'm not sure if it is weakness or emotional drainage, but it seems like if I try a more active video for any more than ten minutes, I just kind of give up halfway through.  


FWIW, taking classes or paying for materials just isn't an option for me.

&amp;#x200B;

So 1. Are there any more active routines maybe in the 15 minute range that you'd know, particularly  a series?    And 2. Does the fatigue I get sound like a physical thing or emotional/spiritual thing?  Or maybe even mental?  How did you get over that block if you've had similar issues?"
yoga,Online Yoga Subscriptions Recommendations,"Hi Everone!

I have been doing yoga on and off for a couple of years and was pretty consistent with doing Iyengar Yoga prior to the pandemic.  That studio has since closed and I realized that I do much better with sticking to practice when I have a class to go to. I've grown accustomed to doing yoga at home and was wondering what everyone else is using as a subscription service or if they have one they recommend. I started the trial for Eckhart Yoga and do like it so far. I have also tried Haus of Phoniex which I really like, however, I was only able to try 3 classes and haven't committed to the membership yet.  I'm not looking for a workout yoga class and when I have too much variety to choose from I feel overwhelmed with what to pick. My goals are to become stronger, and more flexible, and I am seeking the spiritual component, maybe that's any yoga class.  Any suggestions and feedback is welcomed! :)"
yoga,Can't vomit out all water Kunjal Kriya," 

I've tried to do Kunjal Kriya a few times and could not vomit out all the salty water, though I expelled a lot of water. I've been doing 3 liters of salty water 1 teaspoon per liter. I know salty water shouldn't be absorbed by organism, that's when you are doing asanas that propel it through the intestine. But when it is moving slowly it does get absorbed, and I feel swelling in my head afterward and don't feel good.  
I've also heard that when you drink the water slowly then there is a chance you wouldn't expel all of it. I think I've drank it fast enough - a cup immediately after cup

I would be appreciate any help"
yoga,Gomukasana / cow face for guys - variations?,"Hey everyone, this is my first post here so please be kind.

It is just very uncomfortable as there is no space for ""that"" and at times, depending on the position of, uh, my ""guys"", it can be excruciating, as they get squeezed during the pose. Not nice!

Am I doing something wrong? Is this a pose mainly for women? Any alternatives that I could try out?

yoga,Do the spacer beads count towards the 108 in a mala?,Or are they additional to the 108+guru beads?
yoga,Neck pain and yoga,"Hello!

I (25F) am prone to neck pain which extends to my back, shoulders, and sometimes arms. My doctor enrolled me in the waiting list to go to a public/free physiotherapist who is supposed to teach me exercises to develop both strength and flexibility in my neck area. According to my doctor, making my neck muscles strong and flexible would help me prevent neck pain. The problem is the wait could take longer than a year, and paying for a private one is something I can't afford.

People I know who suffer from neck/back pain say that doctors recommend swimming, yoga, and even lifting light weights. I think it makes a lot of sense that yoga is suggested as it is relaxing, it stretches your muscles (flexibility) and tones them (strength). It also corrects bad posture, highly related to neck pain. So I'd like to try yoga at home, but I've never done yoga, and I don't know where to start.

My question is: **can you tell me asanas that are ideal for yoga beginners and relax/stretch/strenghten the neck, back (especially upper back) and shoulders?** If you help me, I could find a video that properly explains the recommended asanas. I'd try them once a day, never forcing my body, and incorporate yoga into my routine. If I saw no improvement or my pain got worse, I'd stop. I've got nothing to lose by trying.

Thanks in advance &lt;3"

yoga,I am a newbie and need some advice,"So i need some advice. I read the getting started section and saw a few styles that are maybe for me: Ashtanga, Iyengar and Yin. I picked these because my main goal is getting more flexible (and getting stronger). I do sprinting and recently started javelin training, but in both disciplines a huge problem is my non existing flexibility. I plan to do yoga every day. Is it best to just pick one style and stick to that one, or mix and match some styles? How would i go about this? My training days are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Also I am a 20 year old male. TIA :)"
yoga,tips to strengthen the upper back?,"Hello hello! I've been practicing yoga for years but never really made much progress. Recently I've been realizing mistakes I've made (trying to replicate the pose without listening to my own body at all, for instance) and trying to correct them. 

However, it's become clear that my upper back is pretty weak, which contributes to poor posture (in my life and in my practice). I really noticed it today when i tried to meditate on the floor, sitting on a cushion; my upper back almost immediately felt overworked and extremely tired when i attempted to straighten my spine. 

I couldn't even do a full 10 minutes because the pain got too intense. It's not like a sharp pain like something is wrong, but it's a dull aching pain like those muscles are doing something outside their comfort zone. 

Do you have any tips for strengthening the muscles of the upper back? 

I'm a 34 year old guy who is overweight but otherwise healthy. I have an old lower back injury (herniated disc) that surprisingly is almost never an issue in yoga. Mostly I've been focusing on yin for my hips (jeez are those boys tight), but this upper back thing feels like it needs to be addressed sooner rather than later.

yoga,Can't blow out all the water after Jala Neti," 

There is always some salty water left after doing Jala Neti. Here how I do it:

* I do Jala net through right nostril, blow out few times, then through left nostril blow out few times
* (maybe I do the process once again)
* then blow 10 times from right nostril, and then 10 times from left nostril, and then 10 times from both nostrils

I do 1 teaspoon per 500ml of water

But the water still remains and doesn't allow to do asanas comfortably.

* Could it be that water had been trapped in sinuses? Sometimes I have tension in my nose between eyes (I think I feel my sinuses), and also I've got tinnitus few months ago. (strong ear ring)
* Could the reason be that I don't lower my head enough so that water flows down the nostrils deep into the throat or sinuses? Maybe I shouldn't raise my head until I blew the water out of my nostrils?

Any help would be appreciated, thanks"

First, my balance on my surgery foot was still pretty great! I guess I didn’t realize that balance really is a skill that won’t just disappear if you don’t use it for a few months. I did a lot of core exercises when I was still unable to walk during my recovery and I think that helped.

Second-if you haven’t been to a hot yoga place yet you need to try it! It got up to 102 degrees in the room because it was a very crowded class. After about 45 minutes of flow we finally lay down and my body just melted into the mat. I felt high, both physically and mentally, and it was awesome 🤪 

Just wanted to share with my fellow yogis, have a great day and I hope you get to try some hot yoga soon!"
yoga,New yoga teachers- how to do get new students?,"I’m a yoga teacher re-building my business post pandemic. I teach yoga in NYC in Central Park. I’ve tried meetup, Airbnb experiences, Nextdoor and just got on classpass. I have a network of ~50 students that I have in a WhatsApp chat to update with class times. I have a Facebook group with 500 likes. I have about 20 5* review on Google/Airbnb combined. I’m current running a 50% off discount and giving new students $10 classes... STILL my classes are almost always empty. I’ve been holding classes since late April and I haven’t been able to get people for more than 10 of them. What can I do? I don’t want to give up, but I’m getting super dejected :("

yoga,Breath work // BIKRAM,"I’m torn with how I should be breathing while doing Bikram Yoga.


On my inhale I breath very low and deep with my diaphragm. 

On my exhale I push the air out of my lunges and bring my navel to my spine. 

Inhale to elongate the spine before the pose and then exhale at the beginning of the pose. Inhale during the pose and while exhaling deepen the stretch. 

Am I supposed to keep my navel in the entire time? 

I ask this because while exiting the pose the instructor says to inhale but also keep the navel in. Any advice or articles I can read would be great!"
yoga,Alomoves: Best Core for Beginner?,"I've had a subscription to Alo Moves for years, I love it.  Best core workouts for a beginner?  I really need to strengthen my core, I had a surgery that weakened me even further there.  I just need a great class for really building strength and that doesn't engage my neck (I know, that's due to core weakness, that's why I'm asking for guidance)."
yoga,Supta Virasana length,Iyengar says up to 15 minutes in this asana may be okay. Personally I’ve often avoided this pose though the years because its difficult for me (ie - I’ve needed to do it). I wonder what works best for others? I tend to stay in it for only a few minutes at a time.

yoga,Breath focus tips/tricks for a beginner with ADD?,"I am a very big novice and practicing at my home and trying to feel wellness and treat my body like it deserves to be treated.

I am still experimenting with different Yoga styles and feeling humbled in my strength imbalances. When I do postures I am weak in. I feel the panic of weakness and I lose my breath control. I think if I keep trying to connect with my muscle through breath focus and meditation I will strengthen these areas.

I have diagnosed ADD, I do not medicate. I worry about heart complications due to family history. I would prefer to be natural, should I practice with a rhythm, metronome or music? 

Much love for the helpfulness in r/yoga community

TL:DR
Are there any recommendations for home practice with an emphasis on breathing and focus cues when you have ADD?"

yoga,Hot take: Ahimsa does NOT mean being Vegan... here's why,"I was vegan for 4 years. I used to judge everyone who ate meat as being ignorant and lacking karuna (compassion). I ate incredibly healthy as well (barely any meat substitutes, and always had my blood levels checked). 

But then things started to change. Slowly in my 4th year I started having digestive issues (cramps, loose stools, brain fog etc). I was diagnosed with IBS and tried to limit FODMAPs, did tons of tests + more.

But despite my best efforts, everything just kept getting worse. I had brain fog every day, struggled to fall asleep, had stomach pain, crazy gas, and my mental health was suffering. This led, naturally, to being more irritable and mean around others. 

I tried incredibly hard to resist doctors advice about eating meat, but eventually gave in... 

I now have a very restrictive diet, and am eating chicken, turkey, fish but all my symptoms are clearing up (over the past 3 months). I have solid bowel movements, no more brain fog, and my mental health is improving. This has made me much more social, helpful, and able to go deeper in my spiritual practices (dharana, dhyana etc)

But does this mean I am violating the Yama of Ahimsa?! No. Here's why: 

Ahimsa means non-violence/non-harming, not being vegan. Although while I was vegan I was not eating animals, I was harming my own body, my own mind, and in turn others around me. Therefore, I was not practicing ahimsa then (as a vegan). I am not practicing it perfectly now, but I am doing the best I can, just like I was then.


If you can be vegan/vegetarian and have a healthy body/mind, that supports you then do it! But there is a very toxic trend in the yogic community that is based on Braminical yogic perspectives, that you MUST be vegan to practice ahimsa (even if it is unhealthy and harming). 

I wanted to share this to hear thoughts, and also to hopefully help others who may be struggling."
yoga,Exercises for shallow breathing,"For about 1.5 years now my anxiety has gotten to the point where I am always breathing shallow, and I often struggle to take a full breath of air. I am active and pretty healthy with a RHR in the high 50s (20M), and I got a bunch of heart and lung tests that came out normal.

I recently got back into hot yoga, and I've been getting my ass absolutely handed to me. The issue is that as I focus on my breathing, it basically triggers a panic attack; I start hyperventilating and my HR refuses to go back down unless I leave the hot studio and take a long breather.

My yoga teacher said that I should a) drink more water and b) practice my breathing, as I tend to take shallow chest breaths (not just during yoga unfortunately) instead of deeper belly breaths.

Any advice on breathing exercises I can do that will help me break the bad breathing habit that I've developed, and maybe help me in the studio too?"

yoga,Karnapidasana,Hi! I’ve been in gymnastics and cheer since I was very little. I’ve always been extremely flexible and never felt struggle when trying to do a pose. However recently I have come across karnapidasana and I’ve been practicing and I can’t even get close. Like not at all. Everybody makes it look so effortless. (My boyfriend who is not flexible can do it like it’s nothing) I’m just so confused as to why this is so hard for me. Have I just never stretched this part of my body before? Is something in my body messed up? I can’t even touch my chin to my chest. Anyways. I’ve been researching and nobody has posted ways to work up to this pose or any stretches to help. Does anybody have any tips? Have you ever struggled with karnapidasana. I feel like I’m the only person lol. I really appreciate any response!
yoga,How do I get back into yoga without feeling so sad for the progress I’ve lost?,"I used to be so into yoga, I’d do it every morning. I was at a point where I was really flexible, really in tune with my body. I wasn’t amazing, only did it by myself for a few months but I enjoyed it a lot. I was at a point where I could tell where the tension was in my body and I knew how to let it go. It was so nice. 

Depression took over really bad and I completely stopped. It’s been over two years or constant depression. I think yoga is what made the difference in my mental health. 

I’ve tried to get back into it a few times but it just fills me with sadness for the progress I’ve lost. It never feels the same. I do the same stuff, same poses, but the tension never goes away. I just lay there and cry on my mat every time I try again. I want to be happy again and I think yoga was the key to how I was so happy years ago. That was the only time I was ever happy in my life, those few months. 

How do I get back into it? Has anyone experienced similar feelings? How did you get past them? I’m so ready to be happy again and get my energy back and take my life back. I just want to feel like it’s possible, and that I’m not alone in these feelings."

yoga,Calling on my tight-hip yogi fam,"Hello! 

Do any of y'all have good hip opening suggestions? Long-term I would love to be able to get into half pigeon but it's incredibly out of reach for me right now. Pretty much all four directions of hip movement for me are tight. So much so that even doing reclined figure 4 feels like straining—and it's hard to relax and breathe into when I'm pulling with my arms like that.

Does anyone have suggestions for passive hip stretches that can help me work towards these more intense poses?"

yoga,Triangle post &amp; knee pain,"When practicing in a studio, triangle was one of my favorite ‘feel good’ poses for my tight legs. I’ve moved to a new state and have been practicing at home while searching for a new studio. 

I seem to be doing something wrong in this pose now that’s casing me significant pain in the back of my knee for a day or two after my practice. I’m pretty sure it’s from hyper extension, but I’m not a doc. This only happens when I add in triangle, and I’m struggling to figure out what I’m doing differently now than I did in guided class. 

My two questions:
1. Any tips on poses/care that help when you have hyper extended your knee and have pain from it? (Aside from the obvious ice and rest. I ask this bc I’d like to keep my daily practice going if possible without causing further harm)

2. Any advice on moving into the pose that I might be missing? I had such an amazing studio and feel like perhaps there were verbal cues or lead in poses that were important and I just can’t remember. 

Thank you in advance!"

I am sure the answer is practice practice practice, and then practice some more. But I really am curious if they take specific types of courses/classes, how many days, how many years, etc., before they got to where they are."

yoga,"Yoga to the ""fitness engineer weightlifter"", overwhelmed","I am probably not a alone here, but there are so many of us who treat our fitness as an algorithm with detailed metrics tracking. I went through a stage of depression and gained 100lbs in 1.5 years and started to show early signs of heart disease. Flash-forward to now and I've lost 40 lbs in 4 months and continue to drop excess fat while maintaining my muscle mass during my lifts at the gym. Despite my weight gain, I'm good at fitness. I'm good at fitness because I am into tracking, analytics, and routine.

If you can follow an algorithm you can lose weight reliably, build muscle reliably.

I track as many metrics as I can so counting calories is something as routine as washing my hands. One metric I've been tracking is my minor injury count. I have been seeing more minor injuries than ever before, knee pain, pulled muscle etc. I know that with my job and my family history, if I don't make a change I'm going to do a lot of damage to my joints and I'm becoming more and more stiff. Currently, I am uncomfortable living with so much tension and stress.

I'm feeling isolated from the yoga community because of the way I approach my fitness. I know that I am a bit robotic. However, it's how I operate. I can sense that very holistic people don't like my methods when asked about my rapid weight loss success.

My main driving goal/fear here is that I don't want to be a burden to my wife as we get older, I want us to enjoy our life together as we age. I'm afraid if I don't make changes in regards to my tension or joint health I will become a burden to her.

Is there a good roadmap I should follow for allotting 60 minutes every alternating day (non-weightlifting day)? Is there some sort of progression of routines I should follow to get from beginner to advanced? All of the information sources in the FAQs are great but yoga never seems like a progression, always an aggregation.

TLDR: Fitness is simple (but requires dedication), following an algorithm with obvious feedback. Yoga is hard because it seems like an aggregation of things to try and there isn't a lot of feedback. Is there a routine to follow long term to get from beginner to advanced (timeline not important)? How should I be tracking my success in terms of metrics?"

yoga,How do I integrate my practice with my life?,"It's a bit hard for me to articulate this so hopefully it makes sense. I've been practicing yoga for years now, at different levels of frequency but I'd describe myself as intermediate in terms of physical ability. I've recently gotten back on the mat for daily practice again after having a baby. I was using the Down Dog app for a while, but it started to feel too ""algorithmy"" drifted back to Youtube (Yoga with Adriene) because I missed the warmth and creativity of a human-led practice. I've also been yearning to amp up the mental aspect of my practice, because I really want to work on being more present. I'm very much in my head and always find my mind wandering during yoga and that's the opposite of what I'm trying to achieve. I'm hoping that my yoga practice can also really set the tone for the rest of my day and be more of a guide to how I react to things. Maybe that's a lot to ask, but it seems like devoted practitioners have been able to achieve this. As of right now, my yoga practice feels too compartmentalized from the rest of my day, and my life in general.

Long story short, how do I boost the mental/emotional benefits of my yoga practice? Is it just a matter of consistency, time, and effort to stay present? How do I really start to live my practice?"

yoga,Ashtanga: remembering the sequence,"I am finishing my 200-hour YTT this weekend. I am studying Ashtanga Yoga. I have to guide a Sun Salutation A + three poses. But I can’t remember the counting and breathing cues without my cheatsheet - which I can’t bring to my exam. 
I have been able to remember the entire Primary Series, but then I got Covid and it affected my memory. Still does.. 

Amy tips on memorizing sequences and counting besides just practicing? I have no one to practice with.."

yoga,Yoga Without Using Legs,"Hi everyone. I recently injured my knee and am now in a knee immobilizer and on crutches. I'm wondering if there are any yoga routines or what poses may be safe for me in my current condition? I can stick to poses that only use my upper body. I have unlooped resistance bands, yoga strap, yoga block and am pretty much confined to my bed atm. I have soreness in my hands, wrists, and shoulders from the crutches that I'd love to work out. 

I'm doing this mostly because I'm bored and don't want to completely lose the strength that I've built up."

yoga,Thoughts on bringing significant other to travel for a yoga retreat?,"I’ve been wanting to visit Bali and stay at one of those yoga camps/retreats for ~2 wks. It’s something that’s been on the back of my mind for awhile now and I finally have the means to do it! I want to make the best out of this experience as practicing yoga is something so personal and intimate to me and was wondering if I should invite my s/o to come with me? I would love to make a solo adventure out of this but if there’s any possibility that I could share all the love and joy I’d get out of this experience w my s/o, that would be awesome. He doesn’t practice yoga himself, but these places (yoga barn, radiantly alive, etc) look like such an oasis that I can’t imagine someone not enjoying one, even if they’re not a yogi. I might be completely wrong tho. Anyone here stay at one of these camps/retreats and can give me some insight? Would someone who does not practice yoga find fun/enjoyment in this setting?"

yoga,Lower eyelid pain from inversion,"I’ve been progressing wonderfully in my practice lately, but I’ve been noticing mild pain in my lower left eyelid when I touch my eye. I didn’t dwell on it: I’m accustomed to minor aches and pains. Two days ago I was hanging out in forearm headstand for about 5 minutes meditating. Super peaceful but now my lower eyelid is rather uncomfortable and I’ve had to stop inversions as the pain has increased. Even down dog is an issue. Anyone ever experienced this? Wondering if a blood vessel ruptured in my eyelid."
yoga,"Affordable Long term Yoga camps/locations, Suggestions?","Hello yogis,

I am considering options for spending 6 months to a year focused completely on fitness. I once stayed 3 months in Laxman Jhula to study yoga, long ago. However I am many years out of practice. I am looking for a place to live and practice long term, where I can afford to live off my residual incomes of about 2000 euro per month after paying my monthly expenses at home. Locations in the US are out of scope for me so I would like to Focus on locations in Europe or Asia with a preference for the Balkan countries (haven't been there).  Locations in central and south America might also be interesting. Places that might also have some light martial arts or Tai Chi type of activities would also be super cool. Also I love hiking and cycling so close by activities would be great.

I am not looking for teacher training although if that is what is offered I am happy to attend such a course in my budget.   
You might ask: Why don't I stay home and do this? To many distractions and I like to travel and see new places."
yoga,Horrible anxiety after hip openers,"Late last night I did a long yin yoga session after months of not really moving my body much, with a lot of deep hip openers, and my anxiety is absolutely horrible right now. Is this normal? I’ve heard that after hip openers a lot of emotion and trauma may come up the next few days because it’s trying to be released from the body. 

How do I ride this wave? Any wisdom for me/what do you guys recommend to keep me grounded and soothe my anxiety?"
yoga,Yogis with bunions - how do you do chaturanga?,"There seem to be two schools of thought when it comes to the position of the toes in chaturanga. One virw says that you should stay on the balls of your toes, the other says that you should rock over to the tips of your toes. I've recently developed bunions, and now neither of these methods are comfortable for me. 

Yogis with bunions - how do you position your feet/toes in chaturanga? Have you found a way to do the pose without aggravating your bunions? 

Thanks :)"
yoga,Is yoga making my sciatica worse?,"I love yoga. It changed my life. I started back in 2019 due to a debilitating sciatic condition. Yoga helped from literally the first class, and that inspired me to become a teacher. My training was so amazing that I stayed for an additional 300 hour course the following month. 

But now, I’m wondering if yoga has perhaps run its course for me. These days, I feel worse after a practice. It doesn’t give me any debilitating pain, but during the practice it feels painful, especially forward folds. For a while I thought I was just pushing my body and a little soreness was the result of that, but that the long-term effects could still be positive. Whereas on the other side of that coin, things that give me relief in the moment are actually making my condition worse in the long-term. For example, taking weight off my left side while sitting. It feels good in the moment but I know bending my spine like that and putting excess weight into the opposite shoulder isn’t good. 

I know the first and most obvious answer is to stop doing those folds, modifying or changing my practice to avoid that pain, but I’m really not thrilled about the idea of limiting my mobility. When I talked to doctors they told me no bending to twisting etc. So basically, don’t move my spine. 

Moving my spine is what makes me feel better though, movement makes space, space brings relief. 

I guess I’m wondering if there are any similar experiences out there, and what you may have done. Forward folds used to be so nice, I’d like for that to be the case again, but the nature of a sciatic injury means the circumstances are always changing. Should I take a break from yoga? Take a break from folds? Stop folding altogether and just accept that not being a part of my practice anymore? 

Thanks in advance for your advice. Namaste."
yoga,Relieving back pain,hey i'm pretty new to this sub reddit. i been having back pain for a couple of years now and thought yoga would be a good start. any positions you can recommend?
yoga,Going back to teaching after 2.5yrs... with a caveat (language),"When I finished teaching at a gorgeous retreat centre, I came back home to take a much needed rest and recover break, and a few months later the world shifted gears and I was forced to put any seeds of my dreams to hibernation. So I focused a lot on my own healing and practice, which has evolved and transformed, providing me with a lot of knowledge, wisdom and insight in the process.

For a few weeks now I have been having this itch to start sharing some of these insights via movement practices again, but there are a few things that are restlessly kindling on my mind:

1) The majority of my input for knowledge and cues has been in English, and a tiny amount in Spanish, and, as a result I have only ever felt comfortable instructing in English. However, now if I were to provide classes, it would have to be in my native language, Romanian, plus I would also have to accommodate on need-base in Russian (which I really don't feel comfortable with). I am aware I might be overthinking this, but it feels like a huge obstacle for me.

2) My approach is quite different than what's on the ""market"" and I am simultaneously afraid of succeeding and failing. 

3) It feels like I will never have enough knowledge and expertise to be fully confident, so I spend a lot of time learning and exploring, experimenting on myself. At the same time, this knowledge demands to be shared forward and outwards, and someone once told me that it is selfish to not do so. 

Having said all that, thank you for reading till the end by the way, what wisdom can you impart, or what experience might you share on any of these concerns of mine, but especially on the language transition?

Thank you &lt;3"
yoga,yoga instructors i need advice,"so i want to become a yoga instructor, and i was wondering what path you have taken to get your training? how long have you practiced before you felt comfortable doing training? is it necessary going out of the country to learn? is online a good option? which program did you use? is there any financial assistance? also which ytt did you do? i know that it’s all dependent on your goals, but i would love just to see which route you all have taken. i don’t mind saving to have a more quality experience. also, did you take any additional courses like anatomy or anything to further your knowledge?"
yoga,Aids for my toes,"Hi everyone! Years after chemo my toenails are still brittle and brittle. I like to practice yoga, but I can't do it barefoot due to this problem... Does anyone know any tricks or ways to avoid this? I don't know if exists aids or any props to stop damaging them...
Thank you in advance!!"
yoga,Ankle sprains and emotional healing needed,"So I used to practise quite regularly a good while back but due to a range of things I got out of the habit. As a result my mental health really took a nose dive and recently I’d begun getting back into things, until I quite severely sprained my ankle the other day! I know from similar previous injuries I’ll be off it for a good few weeks realistically. 

What I’m hoping for is that someone can point me in the direction of some things that I can do at home over the next few weeks to keep me moving and breathing but whilst keeping entirely off my ankle. Are there any styles of yoga I can look into? Or any recommendations of videos I can use to help me? 

My brain really needs this. 

Thanks so much 😊"

yoga,Yoga practice to help release suppressed emotions and traumas,"Hey everyone. So, I’ve been working for years on healing/integrating my traumas. I have C-PTSD and this goes way way back. And it’s undoubtedly multigenerational. 

I’ve tried plant medicines (the South American kind) and while that certainly helps, I do feel like I need to incorporate some sort of yoga practice that helps the emotions come up gently and helps me release them. I feel like otherwise, I fall back into avoidant patterns that make me suppress emotions all over again. 

I’ve heard Hatha yoga is a good option for this. Is that right? Or would you recommend something else?"
yoga,Too much weight on joints? Any tips appreciated!,"When I try to practice yoga, i recognized I put too much weight on my wrists instead of my hands which results in joint pain. It’s been some time since I attended a class and therefore I forgot most of the recommendations my great teacher gave me..How do you manage to disperse the weight on your hands instead of putting the weight on your wrists? Any tips are very much appreciated since this problem really compromises my practice!"

-what course(s) did you take and would you recommend them? 

-what book(s) would you recommend for a beginner? 

-what’s one thing that you would tell your past self before becoming a yoga teacher? 

Thank you so much, I appreciate any and all advice! 🥰"
yoga,Is it disrespectful to practice anything but the ashtanga sequence in a mysore style class?,"Is it frowned upon to go to a mysore class to do your own practice? I much prefer the group setting as opposed to home practice but don’t necessarily align with the ashtanga sequence. I wouldn’t expect the teacher to pay me any attention but I’m sure they could still assist me. I just wouldn’t want to disrespect them nor the tradition.

I align more with the sivananda structure but there are no teachers nearby."
yoga,Asana Questions Thread,Ask questions/discuss asana.
yoga,"Interested in yoga, but also have some reservations I thought I would ask about","I've never tried yoga. But people seem to recommend it for fitness, flexibility, and things like that. I'm a 65 year old male and have lost a lot of weight, so I'm no longer overweight. But I don't really have any upper body muscles. I do walk a lot though. And I'm feeling a bit stiff lately in some joints. I'm thinking maybe yoga is a possible way to go, rather than boring gym exercises. And if it helps with relaxation that's also good.

But my hesitation is what seems like the religious aspect. Can we do yoga without all that? I was reading about ""namaste"" the other day and apparently except in western countries (according to the articles I've read) it's not really a specially significant expression for yoga in the countries of origin. Namaste in those countries is simply a greeting, like hello and goodbye. Is that true?

Anyway, I really don't want to get into any cultural/spiritual/religious Hindu/Buddhist/whatever things. I'm just interested mainly in health/flexibility/strength benefits. *I absolutely mean no offense.* People should follow whatever practices they believe and are comfortable with. But I'm just not into that, and personally would feel uncomfortable with that aspect.

Are there others like me who are just into yoga for health/flexibility/strength benefits and want to avoid the rest? If so, where's a good place to start in that case?

Thanks."
yoga,Tips for practicing with flat feet?,"Hello! I’m 22F and over the past few months i’ve gotten really into yoga, I do it daily and have seen huge improvements mentally and physically! However my flat feet give me some trouble with a lot of the poses.

So the background on this is pretty important, I was born with two clubbed feet and had that fixed up but it started to relapse and I got a minor surgery for it at 4 years old (i don’t think it gives me any problems anymore). The main problem is I also have severe flat feet, I’ve always worn orthotics for it but the right was worse than the left so I had a big surgery on it 2.5 years ago and there is a lot less pain and more flexibility in my right heel cord. However, now there’s a bit of unevenness between the flexibility of my right and left heels, as well as my right foot has less strength and balance than the left because of the surgery (not by a lot, it’s not a concern). 

I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with having these sort of issues that hinder their yoga practice and how i can modify any poses that have to do with stretching the heel cord (eg warrior poses) and balance? It would be greatly appreciated!"

yoga,Is it wrong to feel this way?,"Sometimes in yoga… You ever talk to people and listen to them. One person talks real slow and seems calm or maybe they’re upset idk. Then you talk to another person who is very high energy, talks real fast and very enthusiastic?

I feel like I’m a high energy person. I understand I have high anxiety. What I’m trying to say is … when I try to calm myself and thinking about being calm 24/7 I actually get depressed. But on the other hand, when I accept who I am and accept I’m just a high energy person I feel great. 

My question is…. Why does this make me feel good? When I accept who I am , I tend not to worry about past mistakes or worry about judgment from others. Is there anything wrong with accepting that you’re a high energy person ?"

CORE YOGA 📷📷📷📷

Yoga is so beneficial for a number of things. Most common people think of it when they want a deep stretch, lengthening muscles, and calming their minds. However, any yogi can tell you that yoga is also all about core strength!

When you begin any yoga practice, you’re encouraged to draw your low abs up and in to align your spine and stabilize your body. Most forms of yoga use something called “Uddiyana Bandha” or an upward abdominal lock to keep the spine strong and posture tall.

yoga,hip out of alignment,I went to the chiropractor Jan 2022 and discovered I have uneven hips. Ive been receiving adjustments since.

Is it something I should just accept that won’t happen for me?
yoga,Liforme Mat Slipping and Sliding after 6 months,"I bought my first Liforme mat (black) and used it for 2 years without any issues. I'm a very heavy sweater (Puddle Club!!) and I was always so impressed that it kept its grip. Then tragically I forgot to roll it out and let it dry one time and came back to mold city. So with tail between my legs I bought a second one, this time the blue rainbow one. Now 6 months later, about 15 minutes into class it may as well be a slip n' slide because it has lost its grip entirely. Has anyone else experienced this with the newer Liforme mats? 

I'm probably about to buy a new mat because I'm not able to get through practice on this one and I'm now leaning towards a B Mat. Can any other super heavy sweaters confirm if B Mat or maybe a cork mat work best? Thank you!"

I am a man new to yoga, I went with a friend to my first class last week. I wore basketball shorts with boxer briefs underneath.

To be clear the boxer briefs go down my leg and compress pretty tight on my leg - my genitals are nowhere near exposed. Before I go to my next yoga class I wanted to ask - is it okay for underwear to show when you are doing moves like this? Should I be searching for different shorts that will be more suitable for yoga? I have no male friends that do yoga so I figured I'd ask the community here. Thanks :)"

yoga,I did my first full week of yoga and have some mixed emotions.,"So, I started yoga this week, mainly for mental health for the time being. I enjoy some of the sessions I’ve done, but some I feel like I didn’t do right, or just feel numb to. In general I think I like it, but I’m also already feeling discouraged.

Does it get easier? I feel like I can barely keep up with the movements and I have a hard time taking deep breaths. I want to eventually be great at this and more fit, but I’m really trying to get my mental health better without having to go back on meds.

I’ve been doing Yoga with Adriene, but am open to other suggestions that would be similar and super beginner friendly. I really want this to work but I’m feeling so iffy."

yoga,Yoga clothes that aren't skin tight?,"Hi there!

Over the past two or so years (re: pandemic) my yoga practice became nonexistent and I also gained some weight. Well I'm getting back into yoga again and have found a new studio I like after my favorite place closed (RIP), but I'm just not feeling so great in my old yoga gear. Not only does it trigger some body image issues, but these pieces simply feel uncomfy for me while practicing.

SO what are some of your favorite yoga pieces/brands that AREN'T skin tight leggings? I do prefer tighter fitting crop tops because I hate when my shirt moves around in certain poses, but I would love some shorts/pants suggestions that are preferably sweat wicking (I'm going to a studio that mainly does hot classes) and also looser/comfier?

Thanks!"
yoga,Crescent moon pose progress?,"Hey yogis! 5 8” girl newish to yoga here and I’ve noticed when I hit the crescent moon pose, my hip flexers are ridiculously sore, so I don’t find much movement, while I see people in my class have their back leg almost all the way down. I practice almost daily, and I am hoping that this will be possible over time for me. Has anyone here noticed a lot of progress in deepening their crescent moon? I think my hip flexers right now are just like *hey we didn’t think you were ever going to notice us* lol. 

And can I just say to all you practitioners and yogis how awesome you are! Thank you for inspiring all us newbies, teaching us, and helping so many with their mental health. You guys are like super hero’s."
yoga,Poses/flows to counteract using yogi squats while gardening?,"I have been doing yoga on and off for years and am very comfortable in malasana—actually while working on farms and gardening I frequently end up in this pose for long periods of time while down near the ground planting or weeding. It is much more comfortable for me than sitting on my knees and when it becomes too much I also will use a wide legged forward fold. 

However, after my last shift working on a flower farm, I ended up with massive quad pain/soreness so I’m looking for how I can counteract this and stretch before, during, and after gardening. 

Thanks for any help! Namaste :)"

yoga,suggestions for instructor certification,"Hey! I'm a 29F and exploring the thought of becoming a Yoga instructor. Are all the yoga certification courses considered equivalent when you want to apply for a job or is it like doing your under grad degree where one college is rated higher than the other?

I'm based out of Vancouver, but if it's a short course (with a combo of offline and online classes) I can probably do a part of it from a different country. Also, is the value of online certification less than an in-person class certification?

My intent is not to make this path a way of additional income right now; I have been doing yoga for almost 2 years now on my own and I honestly feel that if I enroll in a course I'll do it more seriously and maybe one day I can try it as a career path when I get bored of software engineering :)"
yoga,Pregnancy-induced yoga hiatus - will I get my groove back??,"Hi fellow Yogis!

I am 13 wks pregnant and I was fairly sick the first couple of months. I started to feel better and now I'm just plain tired! 

I basically stopped doing yoga and now that I'm feeling better I'm trying to get back into it but it's harder now because my muscles turned into flab I feel like. 

Mini back story - Before i became pregnant, I was in a period of mourning since November! So that also put a pause on my yoga...

I feel worried I'll never get back into it. Anyone have any advice or suggestions? 

Thanks in Advance!"
yoga,Modifications for pistol squat?,"At my studio, they have “Level 1” classes and “Level 2” classes. They claim to both be suitable for all levels of experience, so I go to both even though I am by no means an advanced yogi. Normally it is fine, and the level 2 classes give me a good workout and I take the easier modifications they cue as needed. 

However, I have noticed when the owner is attending a level 2 class, the instructors just go absolutely balls to the wall with intensity, and they don’t cue modifications at all. It definitely feels like the class is being taught directly to the owner. Frustrating, but I make do and muddle through with my own modifications.  However, I have no clue what to do for pistol squat which they tend to cue a lot on these days. I usually wind up awkwardly sitting down and then sticking my leg out until the pose is over, but I don’t feel like I am getting any strength or flexibility out of this. Does anyone have any tips for what to do here?"

yoga,Discussion: Psychological remarks of adriene are not really valid or practical. hear this opinion.,"It kinda feels bad for me to say this because she's such a great teacher and provided so many hours of free yoga sessions for me and others. But the only part that I cannot particularly admire is the psychological/motivational statements she makes during some sessions. This happens especially in the 30 day courses and they really feel like sheer romanticism or ethereal psychology. Yoga asanas and especially breathing practices in themselves are helpful towards mental wellbeing, you don't need to ""add"" some abstract statements which only turn out to be mind games and not really relavent to the psychophysiological practice of Yoga. 


But then again, maybe it's something that I just haven't understood yet and it makes sense in the future."
yoga,Chakra Dominance?,"A little bit of context. I've been practicing yoga consistently for almost three, my practice has been mostly physical with some meditation. I consider my practice to be on the point where I don't think much about the actual pose, but feel comfortable enought to reflect on what the pose is doing to my body. 

In one of these introspections I noticed that some of the poses that are easier for me to perform relate to the root, throat and heart chakras. While the poses relating to the crown and sacral chakra requiere more of my attention to execute. I know its natural to have certain body predispositions, but it was a coincidence that caught my attention.

So that brings the question, do people have a dominant chakra (akin to left or right handiness)?

P.S. Sorry if much of this doesn't make sense I'm new to the spiritual side of yoga."
yoga,Learning yoga philosophy and having a hard time,"
Hello! I just recently began taking my yoga practice more seriously, and am in a teaching trainer course that is covering topics on yoga philosophy. We are mainly referencing the Gita and Patanjali's sutras during this course time. These rexts are quite sacred and are literally the building blocks of how yoga started, at least that is what I have gathered thus far. 

In the beginning of this course, my teacher mentioned that yoga is not a religion. I have looked up the differences between religion and spirituality, and I am just confused as to how yoga isn't considering a religion. I'm not trying to offend, and I'm asking for forgiveness toward my ignorance as I am really trying to understand why she made this comment. 

I guess some of the comparisons I've noticed, for example, are between the ni/yamas and the 10 commandments. They both have guidelines on how to live your life in a pure manner in order to reach enlightenment/closer to God. Another example is how most yoga studios have followed the 8 limbs yoga path, and how that will lead you to enlightenment. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this."

yoga,Feel self conscious after instructor laughed at me,"I would like to preface that I’ve never found yoga studios comfortable. But after practicing for a while on my own I longed for comradeship and a safe space where I could meet and practice with other yogis like myself. I finally found a newly made yoga studio run by a super awesome small business owner. It’s small, intimate and had great vibes. Everything I had been looking for! 

All was going well. The more I attended the more comfortable I became and I even made some new friends. The other day after a class, a few of us decided to stay back and work on some inversions. I felt lucky and privileged to learn advanced poses which is typically not practiced in typical yoga studios. 

I was working on my pincha, a pose that I’ve been practicing for two years now. I am on the thicker side and I tremble a lot so naturally I felt my leg shake uncontrollably while I was upside down trying to find my balance. One of the instructors walk in, and she calls me out and starts laughing cause “my your leg is shaking so much, omg” 

This one little interaction has made me wary to go into yoga studios once again. Just wanted to vent. Thanks y’all."
yoga,Wheel Pose Arm Openers,"Hi Folks.  I'm wondering if anyone has any tips and tricks to help support a specific challenge with wheel pose.

I can generally enter wheel without a problem as long as I'm not spent when it's called late in a flow.  I enter by coming onto my head then pressing.

Press strength and the back bed required is not a problem.

My challenge is in the arms.  The stretch required straightening arms after externally rotating hands with bent elbows is tight.  I'm looking for stretches and work to 'open' them.  I'm not even sure if this is shoulders or underarms area ...

I've been using blocks and stretching arms straight in child's pose and elbows on blocks in child's pose.  I've also tried elbows on a table bending forward and arms straight on a wall bending forward.  The funny thing is that now being sure where the tightness is (or things that's causing the challenge) I'm not sure if I'm targeting the right things with these stretches.

I'm working towards a forearm wheel and feel this is what's preventing it.

Thanks!!"

It does not get better when I practice regularly, I would even say it gets worse. I tried ""grabbing"" the floor with my fingers, being really strong in my hands, but to no avail.

Is this something you have experienced as well and have you found a fix for this? Maybe some excercises for the wrists?

yoga,Sick of studio culture?,"Is anyone else sick of studio culture? Specifically, every studio offering teacher trainings &amp; being really preachy about arbitrary “rules” they’ve made up about yoga so that their style is more “yoga” than others. (No mirror. Yes mirror. No music. Yes music. No heat. Yes heat.) 
I’m new to an area and have been traveling around to different studios and 3 times in a row, I’m reminded why I was ok with leaving my home studio but also bummed that I’m encountering the same sales/ ego driven culture. (For background, I started in 2017 at a studio in my hometown, fell in obsessed-love, was convinced to do two teacher trainings over the course of 3 years. Became a teacher and loved it but quickly started to feel gross in my position and have decided not to pursue teaching anymore.)
At my home studio, we had all these movement rules about which way to open the body and why other studios were wrong. We were frequently asked to “sell” trainings before classes and the studio in general was very stuck in one style of teaching and selling teacher trainings. 
I’ve been excited to try new studios and hopefully fine a new culture of yoga and low and behold, it’s the same. Each studio having their own rules, each studio offering teacher trainings “to deepen your practice” or “to teach!”Because the world needs more yoga teachers? 
Why is it like this? Why can’t I take yoga at a studio with teachers that enjoy teaching and don’t have some alternative intention to get everyone to take their training? Why is the ego so attached to the sequencing and methodology of some of these studios? 
Is this just me? I’m feeling like I want the studio experience but it’s been unfulfilling."

However, most of the other teachers and students at one of the studios I teach at come from a Power Yoga background, and I’ve been getting some feedback around making my Vinyasa classes more physically challenging.

yoga,Vision of a landscape during practice,"Hello there! I've been practicing yoga regularly for about 5 years now, but this is the first time I experienced something like this.

As I closed my eyes and looked around I could see more of the landscape and even feel the sand and rock underneath me as I lied down and looked up at the clear blue sky.

yoga,"How am I even supposed to do yoga? Person with gender dysphoria, sensory issues and other stuff being overwhelmed","Hi everyone,

So, I have been doing yoga for quite a while now, but was never able to be consistent. I have back issues and like need to do exercise and yoga is like training all body and you can do it at home without equipment and you don't need to be ""good enough"" like in ball sports, you don't need to go to noisy places and it's something that can be done if you're not super fit. So it's kinda one very obvious option to do. 

It's just... when I have been doing videos of yoga it's always ""how are you feeling"", ""listen to your body"", ""feel into your body"". On a bad day, I hear this, listen into my body, get triggered, and shut down and can't move any more. No way I'd be able to do any yoga after that. I tend to get by with my sensory issues, gender dysphoria and discomfort in my body by dissociating. I know I don't feel good, but I'm trying to do something about it by moving, and shutting down isn't exactly helping me to do something about feeling bad. I just want some gentle exercise, god's sake. 

This is also why I'm so confused why those yogis in videos say ""the hardest part is over, you're on the mat"". Mate, getting on the mat is easy, but I don't know if I will last more than 3 minutes. 

Does anyone have any ideas?"

I had been doing yoga for almost a year, fairly consistent in my practice and I found it helped a lot with mobility and emotional regulation.

yoga,Yoga as a path to self discovery and revelation,"Hiya, everyone. I've been lurking here since I took up a serious (for me) practice 6 weeks ago. For me, serious means that I practice each morning, a mix of stretching, mobilizations and asana and then also practice hot yoga daily at a studio.

As a scientist, I've often been fascinated that in all of our knowledge, we are still working out the very basics of matter. This is how I've come to understand the body before I began practicing.

Of all the things I know and can do, am I aware of the basics in my own body in the here and now? Can I sense, say, my thigh? Am I aware of where life experiences have been taken up in the body by adhesions b/w muscles, fascial planes, etc.? When one muscle that pulls north-and-south lays on top of a muscle that pulls east-and-west, (e.g., the upper back), do they move independently or are they stuck?

I really didn't know anything about my body except for the basics. Once I started paying attention and learning to bring my attention and concentration to my physical experience, my body has started to become known to me. How I distribute my weight, breathe when at rest or tense, etc.

Also, as I decide to tackle chronic stuck areas like my ITB, hamstrings, shoulders, scar tissue around injuries, it's as if more sound and feeling travel into areas of my body that were dead to my awareness, prior.

This post is already too long so I'll stop but I could go on. The beauty of meeting the body and inviting it to be known, and the impacts this is having downstream on the body, a sense of wellness, sleep, kindness, and all the other things....innumerable echoes of peace and lovingness.

yoga,Help Identifying a Pose?,"Been doing yoga for stress and mobility on my own using the app Downdog. Recently I have been dealing with some kind of groin/hip pain (unrelated to the yoga) that gets worse when I sit upright for long periods. A few weeks ago the app had me doing a pose that felt like it was really stretching whatever is hurting in a good way. So I’m trying to figure out if there’s a name to it and also if anyone can know what muscles it stretches.

The app just calls it Janu Sirsasana variation. You are sitting upright and put one leg long in front of you, and bend the other leg to the side so that your heel is close to your butt. Then you lean as far back as you can.

If anyone has any questions to help identify let me know."

What I mean is, when I’m doing any poses that require me to bend forward, I feel as though my belly is pushing into my rib cage and it hurts… It hurts when I’m doing it, and it’s hurting still this morning. I’m sure I’ll have some muscle tenderness doing yoga because I (very) rarely do it and I’m not in shape at all, but I feel like the sharp pain in my rib is probably wrong. 

I used to feel like I was too big to do yoga, but I’ve been proven wrong on that many times, so I don’t know… are there tips or tricks to not injuring my ribs with my belly? I feel like when I try to suck it in I can’t breathe as well. I’ve basically never worked out before so I’m super new and inexperienced in this, and kinda just figuring this out on my own.

yoga,Sharp pain in my left heel after a long series of standing poses. Need your advice.,"Hi fellow yogis, I need your advice here. As the title mentioned, I think I might have injured myself from standing on one leg and holding standing poses for too long. I do power yoga, and yesterday, the instructor was calling for a very long series of standing poses (eagle pose - suspended half moon with sugar cane leg - eagle pose - suspended half moon, repeated 3 times, then warrior 3, airplane, standing pigeon, dancer…). Some poses were very long, 10 breaths each.
I came home, slept, and when I woke up and stepped out of bed, I felt this sharp pain in my left heel. My right heel is fine but I think that’s because my right leg is much stronger, and I did struggle a lot with my left side during class. I did some research, and “Dr. Google” said this is normally seen in people who stand for a long rime or those who are marathon runner. I’m neither of those, and had never experienced this before. I’m young and healthy so I suspected that it must be that yoga class. 
I only feel the pain when standing up or pushing into the heel. I have a friend’s wedding coming up in 2 days but now I’m walking funny. Do you have any advice? Please help."

yoga,Help finding a spiritual yoga style?,"I have searched this sub and can't find what I'm looking for, so figured I'd ask. 

I have recently, within the past 6 months, developed a much stronger sense of spirituality. Mostly readings of Thich Nhat Hanh. I have connected so much to his words about how connected we all are, the illusion of separateness, unconditional love and compassion towards others, ahhh and so much more. 

Previously when I practiced yoga, I felt very disconnected from the spiritual aspect of it and was more focused on the physical. I wanted badly to connect to the spiritual aspect, but it never hit me. I practiced a lot of random videos, and Yoga with Adriene. Personally, I did not enjoy YwA.

Now, I would love to re-approach it with my new perspective. Can you recommend the right yoga ""style"" for me? I read a lot about Kundalini Yoga and thought it sounded promising at first but after reading more about it, I'm turned off by it. Should I be looking for a ""gentle"" yoga? 

Can you recommend any instructors who merge mindfulness meditation and yoga movements? I love language around connectedness, energy, love for others, peace, acceptance, mindfulness, anything kind of ""woo woo."" At this point, I am finding yoga practice that does not incorporate more spirituality than it does aerobic physical activity meaningless to me.

Help!"
yoga,Yoga made me love my anxiety,"Everybody is different.
I’m a man who comes from a very athletic sport background. After years of being stiff and having nagging injuries I decided to try yoga. 

For the past year of doing Bikram hot yoga and I fell in love, it’s my new passion. But I’ve stopped and started back up many times due to mental confusion with myself. 

My whole life I’ve been a naturally high energy kind of guy. I talk fast, I work fast, I love coffee and sometimes me being me I feel like rubs people the wrong way. 

When I first started doing yoga there were many calm chill people there , people not like me. I thought something was wrong with me. I tried meditation, I tried slowing down who I AM. But it just made me feel depressed. 

Long story short, I just decided to accept myself through yoga and not worry what other people think of me. Maybe I have a lot of anxiety , idk , but I can’t change who I am. I am who I am ."
yoga,Yoga makes me hate my body,"I started doing real yoga a few months ago. I had a serious back injury a few years back and have been dealing with chronic back and hip pain ever since, on top of being very active. Someone suggested I start doing yoga about four times a week, and since I've tried basically everything else, I figured why not, and gave it a go. 

Now, I love the way yoga makes me feel physically. It really does help a lot and I'm getting some balance back I lost after I hurt my spine. I do plan on continuing to do it.

That being said, it makes me incredibly insecure. I hate having to look at my legs in forward folds and seeing stretch marks, I hate seeing my stomach when I'm bent over, it's like I'm being forced to look at all these tiny insecurities for minutes at a time. I was never a super confident person, but being so ""close"" to what I look like and what my body is during yoga really makes me feel bad about myself.

I know yoga makes a lot of people feel really appreciative of their bodies and they enjoy the connection they have to their physical self. But I'm really struggling with it. And I can't just close my eyes and pretend it all isn't there. If anyone has struggled with something similar, I would love to hear some advice. 

Thanks all."
yoga,Why did yoga make me anxious?,"I went to my second ever yoga class today. It’s a mix of energetic poses, stretching and relaxation at the end (apologies if I’m using wrong terms, I’m new to all things yoga). 

My first class last week went great and I was feeling so happy after. 

Today, at the end, possibly last 10 minutes when we were doing relaxation, I felt uncomfortable. Waves of anxiety were going through my body and mind, I couldn’t focus or relax. My chest felt heavy and I felt like each breath was making me uncomfortable. 

I signed up for this class to relieve my anxiety and stress, but today felt weird. Is this normal? Is this a way of my body to release negative emotions/energy? Why the hell am I close to an anxiety attack during yoga relaxation?"
yoga,Visual evidence of daily yoga practice,"I have an odd question and I’m not sure if I’m posting in the right place so please let me know if I need to change something. 

I’m excited that I’ve started a daily yoga practice (10 days and counting). My question is that I want to have a visual of each day adding up, if that makes sense? 
So for example people who are losing weight will have two jars with marbles to show how much weight they have left to lose and how much weight they’ve lost. Obviously I’d only have one jar that I’d be adding to with each day I complete a yoga practice. However, idk if I want to do marbles or a jar but I know I want it to be physical (not just a habit tracker page). 

Any thoughts?

yoga,Yoga and samadhi,"Hey, I'm a complete beginner to yoga but I'd say quite familiar with its cousin - sitting meditation (a decade or so of practice). It lately dawned on me that I've become skilled in stilling my mind...only to have a more clear awareness of my body more or less feeling like a bag of rubble and twisted steel with some redbull poured over the top. That's the result of years of chronic stress, sleep apnoea and other adrenaline -heavy pressures. 

It's only lately I started appreciating that I really need to learn how to calm, soothe, relax my body and nervous system, not just the things that happen from the neck up - attention, thought stream etc. I'm looking through the wiki, faq, YouTube and I'm finding it quite overwhelming with just how vast the yoga universe is. A lot of resources seem like scattered, follow along fitness oriented McYoga tutorials. It's the equivalent of guided, western mindfulness which only goes skin deep.

For someone whose nervous system feels like a guitar string cranked 5 times past the ideal point of tension...which yoga modality would be a suitable start, providing I've got a half decent general fitness level. I'd also love to hear stories of people who've had a sitting meditation practice and how these two complimented each other or perhaps covered each other's blind spots. Thank you."

I'd appreciate some help, I've really begun to enjoy Hatha yoga and want to learn it deeply, the only resource I've turn to are the books on poses and anatomy by Dr. Ray Long.

yoga,Breathing help,"Hello yogi’s,

I’m hoping some of you might be able to help me with my breathing during practice. 

Is it normal to have shaky breathing during your workouts? When I began practicing 2 months ago, I assumed it was because I was so new to it, but honestly my situation hasn’t improved in the slightest. 

I admit that I am typically a shallow breather (one of the many reasons I started in the first place), and my core is still quite weak. So there are other factors, but I can’t seem to breathe fully and controllably, especially during faster or more strenuous flows. 

Is this something I just have to power through until it improves? Is there something I should be doing differently? Any insight would be helpful. I can only assume I’m not alone here.

For reference, I practice at home. Yoga with Adrienne mostly, but I also use the Down Dog app occasionally.

yoga,Why Devotion is the Highest Yoga,"I searched for truth my whole life, and yet I wandered and could not understand it. 

One day I became very anxious. My mind was clear but my heart was bursting. I could not fix my condition by medication, or exercise, or breathing, or any method. I considered I may die.

In very devoted and sincere effort I sought to learn meditation. I found a teacher and I gained skill quickly (also have a history with hatha yoga). 

Suddenly my every anxiety was woven into an aura of bliss. Every choice was simple, and I knew exactly how to Love life completely. Even in the face of tragedy my conscience was clear, and I feared or desired not what may come next, so there was no miseries or wandering thoughts. 

I saw my own reflection in the eyes of others, yet I did not truly know myself until then. I saw that we are all born of the same energy. That our core is the same, and only our conditions of worldly life are different (memories/ego). And that all evil is inspired from injury, greed, or lust for material pleasures. That these things are even the cause of our suffering, so the people who act poorly to others and themselves, they know not true happiness but only suffering. Born in this lost world as we all are. 

But the power of mind it took to rid the world confusion from my head was too great to sustain. 

I could not continue to see the reality, the face of God, which is a bliss of true creativity, true love, and wholly authentic inspiration, by power of mind alone, it was impossible to forget the world continuously by power of will. 

But I was so hungry from the things and the true love and bliss that I’d seen. 

I devoted all my energies to sharing my methods and teachers, to reciting from memory the Glories of the Supreme Source and Personality. Who I saw that we are all fragments of, and not different in essence from me or God.

I thought that these things I’ve found are more powerful than anything I’d known, that they are the origination of everything I’d known. And by that virtue I was completely inspired to devote my being to it, to sharing practices and spreading its glory. Even if I was never to see it again, because of my own inadequacies. 

During this time I have spent, I have cultivated A Divine Love for the Supreme. And I have found that in sincere love and devotion, for the Supreme Person (who is within my heart as my truest self/holy spirit) and the beings created of, it is the most powerful and sincere method of Self Realization. 

This devotive manner of being, a pure love for existence and everyone in it, and clear inspiration etc, is the ultimate attainment of any type of yoga. 

So by developing this loving and authentic lifestyle, it is like creating a savings investment. We don’t lose the rememberance of true devotion, it is the sweetest way we can live by far. While we may certainly lose the skills of presence and renunciation from other paths of Yoga, if they are not mastered and practiced regularly. By experience I can testify.

The amount of sincerity and energy we put into our devotion will determine what we get out of it. And while our devotion is growing, it is acceptable and advisable to use other forms of Yoga and meditation to increase your capacity to love and be yourself. 

And through this devotion we lose taste for material pleasures. Slowly we become to love life and wholesome things so much, that when we do conditioned material things (sin?) we lose our love and we want it back because it is the favorite way to be. In this way we increase our devotion and happiness, and the taste for doing inauthentic things decreases. It is the only way to be safe from any “sin” and the churches are proof that fear only inspires people to sin secretly and become seriously shamed within themselves about it. 

I became skillful in mind practices, and it led to my realization. But I have lived a potent and playful life, and I’ve had great devotion for music and love before I ever walked knowingly on some spiritual path. 

Devotion is the path, and the destination. Other spiritual methods and yogic techniques are simply vehicles to travel by. And without seeing of the path or destination, all the vehicle does is get you more lost faster."

I was wondering what is more important/what I should focus on mastering first: having my heel flat on the ground or getting a deeper stretch, especially regarding the squat. It seems from what I found on this sub, the heels being flat on the ground in downward dog is something you work towards, but I didn't know if that was similar with the squat or if it's more important to just try and get low.

Now, after 2+ full years of using both mats 2x/day 7 days/ week , I'm convinced that the PROLight manufacturing process has made it significantly more slippery! I've done all the breaking in methods on both mats (scrubs, wear and tear, intentionally scuffing, chaulk) and at this point I only feel completely secure on the PRO, the PROLight might start off okay but by the end of a vigorous 90 min class it's game over. I don't do hot yoga, and don't produce enough sweat or general body humidity for yoga towels or cork mats. But I'm at a pretty advanced stage in my aasana practice were slipping is becoming a liability. I'm also not keen on the feel of natural rubber or lack of durability with other brands, so I'd really like to stay with this brand. 

Does anyone else have the same experience? Should I just suck it up and carry around the heavy PRO instead of fussing with the other mat?"

I've been doing yoga for a few years now - but only *very* seriously and consistently for about 15 weeks. Before then, it was twice a week for a few months, then nothing, then twice a week for another few months, etc - you get the idea. 

 I'm making great progress in my flexibility and have honestly never felt as strong as I do now. It's fantastic. 

But every single time I move into wheel pose, I'm convinced that I'm going to fall out of position onto my head, break my neck and die. It's all I can think about when I'm there - that my hand is going to somehow slip and - *boom, craaack* : no more deprechanel.

yoga,Question regarding increasing Sattvic Guna,"I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask (please remove if it isn't). Patanjali's Sutras mention the importance of being Sattvic for the practice of meditation, i.e. keeping the mind Sattvic and reducing the Tamas and the Rajas Guna as much as possible. This includes not consuming any sort of meat or ""dead"" food (animal products), which are tamasic in nature.

Now, for someone who is into calisthenics and would like to continue building lean muscle through progressive overload, but also be able to keep the mind as Sattvic as possible for meditation and it's practice - is it feasible / possible to increase sattva and decrease our Rajasic and Tamasic gunas like the enlightened Yogis WHILE maintaining a physique of an elite weightlifter?

I'm not sure if the nature of our workouts could be considered Rajasic if it is compound movements like the planche, handstand pushups, weighted pistol squats, weighted pull-ups, and some running / sprinting, etc.

Regarding diet, building quality lean muscle and size obviously requires eating a ton of food that is protein rich and calorie dense.

So, if we are to switch from a meat based diet to a Sattvic diet which includes fresh fruits, vegetables, vegetable sources of protein and whole grains, can we still reduce Tamas and Rajas while maintaining a high Sattva Guna? TIA."
yoga,Sleeping in Yoga Nidra,"Hello!

I'm fairly new to yoga, and have been trying many different practices. Today was my third time in a yoga nidra, and I keep falling asleep with in a few moments. 

The studio I go to is very nice and doesn't make me feel guilty, but I want to better the practice for myself. I've tried opening my eyes when I feel like I am going to fall asleep, but it always comes without much warning. Does anyone have advice or tips for staying in the meditative state without completely falling asleep?"
yoga,Searching for Pranayama training in India,"Hi,

I have been looking for a 200 hour yoga teacher training in India with a pranayama focus. I would like to teach pranayama but also other styles of yoga. I want to be yoga alliance certified and I don’t want to participate in any cleansing rituals. (Eg; forcing yourself to vomit…) 

I’m recovering from a chronic illness and I’m concerned about my body being totally up for a typical 200 hour training, and after what I went through with my health, I feel more moved towards teaching breathwork than intensive physical activity. But I want to learn as much about yoga as I can.

However, I can’t really find what I am looking for. Most places just teach the basic 200 hour training. Am I being too specific? I’m searching in India because it is the most affordable and I would really like to travel there. 

Does anyone have a better suggestion for me? 

Possibility finding a less physically intensive ytt and follow it by a pranayama training? Or should I just get trained in pranayama and/or breathwork and forget about the rest of it for now?

Thanks for any input!"

yoga,Back to daily practice,"Hello all, 
I have practiced yoga on and off over the last several years. I had worked my way up to daily practice for about 6 months before I got sick and then injured my back. I am ready to get back to it, but feel very weak. Do you have any suggestions for easing my way back into daily practice and how to build my strength back up. It has been about 3 months since I was able to practice daily. I do not want to injure myself by overdoing it. Thank you! I practice at home and have never been in a studio setting except for a couple classes back in college."
yoga,decision difficulty for daily practice,"I want to start this off by saying that I am a person that can't just pick a yoga video for the day. If I don't have a calendar/program that I'm following, I'll say to myself that I want to spend time on yoga and then spend the whole hour I should be doing yoga, I'm looking for a video and overwhelmed with options. 

I've done yoga with adriene calendars and I get so bored with such similar videos and sequences, and most of them feel beginner level with no way for me to advance. other 30 day ""programs"" all feel geared towards beginners..  the DownDog app causes difficulty for me choosing which type I want to do, I feel like I need a system/formula with different types of flows. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for programs/schedules/routines that are available online for free (other than ywa- I've found them not challenging and boring)? If not, are there any suggested methods for organizing youtube videos to put them into a specific schedule, how should I space out the variety of types of yoga in a methodical way so I can stick to practicing daily and also not get bored? All yoga videos and in-person classes I've been doing have started feeling all the same to me, so I'm looking for how to advance also. I haven't done yoga recently just because I can't spontaneously pick a video/class for that day.. :( 

I know its not very yoga of me to want to apply guidelines to my daily practice, but due to my personality (?) I don't think I would be able to practice daily without some sort of system... It's just how I work I guess but it's tricky."

I am teaching private classes (nowhere enough to survive) and have set up instagram profile for more visibility. Have 5 years own practice in ashtanga, 14 years in Iyengar yoga. I am based in Berlin, which probably matters. Would love to hear about you experiences, maybe even struggles and ways you were able to deal with them. 

Also, looking for general advise."

yoga,Need help going from doing routines in the morning to the afternoon,"I’ve stretched and worked out early in the morning for a month now, and it has drastically made my schedule dysfunctional and made me lose a bit of confidence. You see, being taught that exercising in the morning makes you lose weight as someone who is vulnerable and doesn’t even need to lose weight is a very tempting thing to do to boost confidence. (Did the opposite because i just overworked my muscles early instead of stretching)

yoga,How to keep a routine?,"Hi everyone!

I'm a complete novice to yoga; started about two weeks ago with Adriene's 30 days series, and I am loving it. However, I'm already dreading the day I run out of the 30 day playlists (I know there are multiple, but they're sadly not infinite, hahaha) as I already have a terrible time trying to keep any sort of routine in my life, and I'm afraid that it will all sizzle out when I don't have the set structure of those playlists. It doesn't help that I'm super overwhelmed with the thousands upon thousands of instruction videos!
So, I'm just wondering how you guys tackled this. How did you keep an eye on the forest in spite of the trees? Things I should keep in mind when trying to select different kinds of practice? Any recommendations are always welcome, of course!"

yoga,Cannot Flatten My Hands Without Pain,"Hi , I did a search for this and couldn't find anything similar, so I hope this is OK to ask here. 

I love doing yoga but whenever I have to do anything with my hands flat on the ground (down dog, cat/cow, any type of plank etc.) I get sharp pains along the pinky side of my hands (both left and right). I end up curling my fingers in and placing my fist on the ground instead, which I know is not ideal, but it is so painful otherwise. 

Has anyone dealt with this, or maybe you are an instructor who has had students have this issue, and figured out a way to make this work. I really like doing yoga and I am aware that eventually, maybe, if I keep trying, my hands will become more flexible, but because of the severity of the pain, I don't want to keep trying and do lasting damage.  

Some Background - I am definitely a beginner and am overweight, but even if I'm not putting my weight onto my hands, for example, I try to place my hand flat on a table, it hurts, not as much as when I have my weight over them, but it's still there. 

Thanks for any advice or ideas you might have!"

yoga,Seated Poses for improved posture,"I typically am seated for longer periods of time while doing homework and studying.. so I tend to get back aches from slouching or just sitting uncomfortably. I've been trying to sit in a new seated pose/position every 15minutes or so. Today I tried the half lotus pose, for opening the hip flexors. I have also found that doing rounds of cat/cow have been helpful during long periods of sitting. I also try to take breaks for breathing meditation and mountain pose for circulation. It helps but as soon as I sit down again, my back tends to slouch unintentionally and it can get pretty painful.

Is there any other suggestions for posture and back pain you'd recommend?"

yoga,Advice on self practice,"Hello everyone! 
I’m practicing yoga for a while with classes from YouTube. In the last few weeks I’ve started to deepen my practice with taking classes all about breathing and reading some books, in order to do practice on my own. I tried to do few practices on my own and it felt wonderful, right for me and much more interesting.
But, naturally I’m repeating more or less the same asanas that I already know and and I find it a bit hard to choose the right asanas that will take my practice further, especially if I want to include counter poses etc. So I wanted to ask if do you plan your practice? Do you sit maybe with a notebook and write your plan before? or just doing what feels right for your body at that moment? Do you have a long term plan? And maybe do you think it’s good to stick to some basic asanas as a base and add to that something different in every practice?
Thank you for your time🙏🏼🙂"

yoga,"Looking to start yoga, will doing ALMOST just yoga be ok?","A little bit over a month ago I (29F) finally started exercising. 

So for my whole life I took my body for granted and done almost nothing phisically (there were some short periods of struggle which ended up in failure). It was never an issue as my body was pretty gratefull. I am 155cm short? and had 53kg, which was really fine for me. But 2 years ago everything went bad. I currently have 63kg, and for the past year I'm just hanging around those 63kg. There were major things that changed in my life, working from home being the most impactful one. I also study a lot - on my PC, so I'm sitting somwhere around 11 hours daily, sometimes 12. I have a dog so I do a bit of walking around, but nothing that would compensate for 11 sitting hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate exercising. Always had. It's hard, of course. That being said, the month that I managed to keep up without skipping really had an impact on me. I still feel a bit of resentfull and do that just to 'take if of my list', but I noticed that I started thinking about it a bit more, like what could I do better, what could I improve, and it certainly didn't hurt gaining a little bit of strength. 

In any case, my exercise program is short. I started with 15min HIIT sessions 4x a week, and kept that up for 2 weeks (that was prior to my month of exercise). My only goal was to 'not skip a session', like make a habit out of it. And after that I added squats. So for past month I've been doing squats with 10kg weight, 150 of them, and that would take around 15 mins, and after that I do HIIT for another 15, so all in all I have been exercising for 30 mins, 4x a week. Needles to say, I only do the same exercises, because whole 'exercising' is so unfamiliar to me, and I honestly don't know what else to do.  I am so proud that I managed to keep it up, it might sound like nothing to most people, because it seems like the whole world is now exercise oriented, but not skipping my sessions is a win for me.

&amp;#x200B;

But now on to the yoga. I actually wanted to do yoga for the past few years, but I would very much prefer to go to in person classes rather then do it like I do it with my HIIT dude over youtube. 

I am not looking to lose weight, well I am, but that is not most important thing, I am looking to change my lifestyle, and all info that I read point yoga to doing just that. But then I read again, and people on reddit say oh thats not enaugh, you need to do cardio next to that and also lift weights, do the gym and it feels like I have to do so many different things! It all just makes me feel so lost in all of that information. I just don't have time to go swimming, then do some hiking and after that do the gym and then yoga as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I commit to yoga classes, and also keep my 30min at home exercise routine, will that be enaugh? Will I be able to tone my body with just that? And also will it be weird if I started attending in class yoga - being so unflexibile and weak, would it be better to just start first at home, not to embarras myself?"

My friend said there's a bunch of online resources to try.  His wife uses something called almoves, which looks like $9 a month, which isn't bad at all.  I did a quick Google search, and found [this](https://www.prevention.com/fitness/workouts/g32632506/best-yoga-videos/).  They all look good, but now I have the *opposite* problem... too many resources!

I trust my friend, but I'd also like to get other peoples' opinions, especially when there are free resources all over YouTube.

What are some recommendations for someone just starting?

I've got a powerful frame, but I'm not a limber person in the slightest.  I'm one of those people who really does need to stretch before playing tennis bicycling, or else I get bad muscle cramps.  I'm strong willed -- I can hold a plank position for 2 minutes or touch my toes / palm the ground through sheer will alone.  My friend, OTOH, is really toned and limber, and can do those things pretty effortlessly.

I'm assuming Yoga is like everything else in this world -- one size does not fit all.  Are there any resources for someone like me?  I'd really like to give this an honest try.

Thanks!"
yoga,What do I do about my wrist?😭,"For at least the past 4 weeks, my left wrist has been really bothering me when I put any kind of weight on it.  Low plank &amp; crow in particular are pretty painful.  I’ve been using tight compression wraps and (this is not healthy I know) taking 3 Tylenol before I practice to help me power through.

I suspect I may have twisted something during a flip dog pose (flip dog to full wheel, *turn around on one hand back to down dog*) OR perhaps my wrists just not appreciating supporting an extra 30lbs of body weight (recently I had an 8 month period where I gained like 30lbs and then lost it pretty quickly).
Idk.

In any event- what do I do?  A few people have said “go to a doctor” but what is a doctor even going to do?  I can’t imagine needing an x-ray or anything.  Is anyone going to be able to do anything besides tell me to stay off it?  I’ve been practicing Baptiste hot yoga for like 3-4 years and I’m only 32 so it’s not like I am overextending myself too much.

I’m mostly concerned because it’s my left wrist and I am very much a lefty so it’s not like I have a spare lol."

Today was the first time that I managed to do a short meditation in Lotus Pose and I'm not even joking when I say that those 10 minutes were more challenging for me than a 10 mile run.

yoga,Advice on mat!,"Hello all! I am new to yoga (and now completely obsessed). I attend hot yoga class 5-6 days per week now, and I’ve started having pain in the heels of my hands and marks on my elbows from forearm poses, etc. I have been using a cheap Gaiam mat (4mm) I purchased from Target with a thin Shandali towel (Amazon). 

Slipping hasn’t been too much of an issue with the towel, but without it, it’s a disaster. I am also extremely petite, 4’10”, so I generally don’t struggle with my mat moving around on me. 

However, now that I’ve been doing hot yoga so frequently- I want to invest in a better mat- price is not a concern, I just want the best mat possible. 

What I am looking for is something that is more cushioning on my hands and knees, but also has good grip for hot yoga. 

I looked at the Manduka Pro for the comfort factor, but read it has poor traction without a towel, which I can use but it would be nice not to need it.

I’ve also been looking at the Yahola cork mats, which have great traction but less cushion…

Is there a happy medium between comfort and traction? What is your favorite mat? Also worth noting that comfort is more of a priority than traction ultimately, because I can always use a towel. 

Thank you!"

yoga,Mods for painful toenails in a vinyasa,"The top of one of my toenails has started to hurt, so I'm trying to avoid putting pressure on it for a while. The issue is doing upward-facing dog when doing a vinyasa. I can think of 3 possible modifications:

* Simply curl up the toes a bit into the sole, so that the weight is all on the top of the foot. Pros: the least difference from regular up-dog. Cons: it doesn't feel great, almost like the sole is going to cramp
* Do up-dog with toes curled under, like [this](https://images.ctfassets.net/p0sybd6jir6r/3wUJTxblLMEVN6dKz03zRo/dfee63bc4de250b6ab13dba0acf929c9/upward-facing-dog-pose-variation-4d07e3d2e892442b67eb876741757468.jpg?w=1600&amp;q=70). Pros: also still similar from regular up-dog. Cons: the backbend seems deeper, and it feels like it gets into my lower back more, and doesn't feel great, either.
* Do a slow chatturanga pushup (so no, backbend at all, simply lower into chatturanga and come straight up). Pros: Feels nice, strengthens the shoulder and core. Cons: No backbend.

Any other possibilities I'm missing? And which of the three above (or any others) would you recommend? Thanks in advance!"

yoga,When can I do yoga after a motor vehicle accident?,It has been 6 days since the accident. I can now walk and do some light chores but my back hurts everytime I do any physical work.
yoga,Can't push with right arm - ideas for working around it?,"I can't now and likely won't be able to hold my weight when lowering down from the top of a push up. It's a combination of nerve damage and weakness, not sure how much of which but more nerve damage given it was no problem just a couple of months ago. 

Started yoga early last year and practiced (studio classes at my gym) about 3x per week. Few months ago I started getting nerve pain down my arm....long story short....I am told I will need surgery soon. In meantime, since \*most\* of my arm pain has gone away (leaving behind it weakness), I've gotten the greenlight to exercise so long as I don't risk jarring my head or any contact sports etc. I never could do a crow pose so no concerns about bumping my head :) For those interested - I have cervical myelopathy due to multiple compressions of the spinal cord + multiple disc herniations. The only reason I found out was due to the pain, which is due to a pinched nerve (C6/C7) and eventually getting an MRI. Surgeons all surprised I can even walk based on the MRI, let alone attempt yoga, but until surgery, which will be after this summer, I'm clear to do yoga if I can. Problem is, I tried on Monday night and at the top of a pushup, on way down to updog my right arm just gives out and I drop to the mat. I can muster enough to barely catch myself at the bottom. Problem is, for the following 3 days my arm was in much more pain than it had been. Could be the yoga in general but I think it could just be the lowering down to the mat. 

Most of the nerve pain is gone now and I have been doing some cardio the past two days but really want to see if I can give yoga one more shot. Has anyone broken an arm or something where they couldn't use their right arm, and still were able to practice? Ideas for working around this?"
yoga,"UGH.... Perfectionism, frustration, eating disorder, etc. Please help!"," I am currently recovering from an eating disorder. I have issues with socializing because I've been truly quarantining for 5+years (I have very limited transportation and no friends). This all contributes to festering envy and frustration. Whenever I see a runner or a biker, or someone who is better at yoga, I want to rip my hair out (and do worse). I'm so jealous. I feel so disgusted with the fact that I can't do some poses. Is it normal to not conform to certain poses some days?"
yoga,Third Eye,"I lost my ego through telling myself while looking in the mirror and recognizing how everything I see is only clear if I accept the true way it makes me feel.

Why you can't Skip the ego loss part you may ask?

Your ego has nothing to do with your body(id), passions and non self critical values(superego).

**That we see everything in the speed of light(allowing us to see four dimensional). This is because Albert Einstein's theory was right.** 

**This is true because when you look in the mirror on shrooms or acid and do not question yourself and your morality and what you love you don’t see infinite images in the reflection anymore, that means that physical objects are what blocks time and Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity is right.** **This is proof of the third eye.**

The third eye, consists of the left side of the brain(rational), the right side of the brain(creative), and the cerebellum (which may be used for planning movements and motor learning, this area functions in regulating body movements by allowing for error corrections, area is involved in controlling balance and flexes of the eyes) These three parts of the brain must interacts simultaneously at a rate which is instantaneous, as long as all the information being interpreted is not questioned.

The left side of the brain is the side left brain handles mathematical equations

logic

facts

mathematics

linear thinking

sequencing

thinking in words

This can be proven any time you take shrooms or acid and look in the mirror. As soon as you start to question how the object your looking at, whether it's yourself, your own eyes, or something behind you is able to be so unique, then all of the natural ability which acid gives you suddenly no longer exists.

This is some scary breakthrough. And having this knowledge was just too much to share with the world without a book to explain how this phenomenon is actually connected to every genius in psychology that I have studied who has helped me get to a place where I was able to have this breakthrough.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After doing this I discovered that there was one person who had completely explained why they trust their psychological theories in every circumstance and how it must be connected to neuroscience. Well, that is exactly what I did.

Because without it being made into a book... which is what I was able to do through philosophers to make it beautiful, it would be. I have merged ideas from various philosophers/ scientists/ psychologists including Plato, Rene Descartes, Sigmond Freud, and Socrtates, Albert Einstein, Gerald Edelman and Sir Isaac Newton. There may some typos, but if you reread each sentence that is confusing, I think you will get what I am trying to say.

Which is why I call it the The Beautiful Surprise Principle.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 I think this is a powerful insight, and thank you for sharing. Meditation has told me the same thing, but I'd forgotten it and you've reminded me.

It can be so easy to let our vision blur to the things that emotionally bombard us day after day, but to see them clearly is precisely what we need in order to interface with them properly and resolve the feelings.

I lost my ego through telling myself while looking in the mirror and recognizing how everything I see is only clear if I accept the true way it makes me feel.

Your ego has nothing to do with your body(id), passions and non self critical values(superego).

**That we see everything in the speed of light. This is true because when you look in the mirror on shrooms or acid and do not question yourself and your morality and what you love you don’t see infinite images in the reflection anymore, that means that physical objects are what blocks time and Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity is right.** **This is the third eye, wake up. You are rare.**

Why is all of this so difficult to understand. Well this is why.

“In daily life it happens all the time that we presume that the psychology of other people is the same as ours. We suppose that what is pleasing or desirable to us is the same to others, and that what seems bad to us must also seem bad to them. It is only recently that our courts of law have nerved themselves to admit the psychological relativity of guilt in pronouncing sentence. The tenet quod licet Jovi non licet bovi still rankles in the minds of all unsophisticated people; equality before the law is still a precious achievement. And we still attribute to the other fellow all the evil and inferior qualities that we do not like to recognize in ourselves, and therefore have to criticize and attack him, when all that has happened is that an inferior “soul” has emigrated from one person to another. The world is still full of bîtes noires and scapegoats, just as it formerly teemed with witches and werewolves.”

“Projection is one of the commonest psychic phenomena. It is the same as participation mystique, which Lévy-Bruhl, to his great credit, emphasized as being an especially characteristic feature of primitive man. We merely give it another name, and as a rule deny that we are guilty of it. Everything that is unconscious in ourselves we discover in our neighbour, and we treat him accordingly. We no longer subject him to the test of drinking poison; we do not burn him or put the screws on him; but we injure him by means of moral verdicts pronounced with the deepest conviction. What we combat in him is usually our own inferior side.”

Excerpt From Collected Works of C.G. Jung, Volume 10: Civilization in Transition Jung, C. G., Hull, R. F.C., Adler, Gerhard

As time goes by and the third eye calcifies, we forget our neighbors, we forget what makes us, truly us. 

The pineal gland is responsible for producing melatonin, a derivative of serotonin that will provide seasonal functions and the wake/sleep schedule of the body. As you age the pineal gland can become calcified, causing calcium phosphate to develop over the gland

Your [brain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/picture-of-the-brain) contains a small pine cone-shaped gland called the [pineal gland](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/endocrine-system-facts). It’s about the size of a grain of rice. However, that size can vary in animals depending on their location. 

‌‌The pineal gland plays the role of controlling your [sleep patterns](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-101), how you make decisions, and how you perceive reality. The gland produces a hormone called [melatonin](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-940/melatonin) for these functions. 

‌For peak performance and psychological development, the pineal gland must remain healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Meditate.**

Some may ask If you lost your ego, who showed up and said I?

&amp;#x200B;

The answer to that question is serotonin, I recognized, that we are the drugs that are passing through our body, and chose to focus on that specific one

&amp;#x200B;

and the things not that I knew brought me happiness... because I did not have to think about it... because I was simply already feeling the happiness that it was bringing me and not allowing myself to ever settle for the thought that I am that happiness. K knew that I am the body that allows this happiness to be physically produced day after day.

It seemed to happen overnight as well, and nothing I’ve done has corrected it. It’s been months of dealing with it and I’ve finally reached my wits end, as it’s ruining something that I see fairly important from a connection standpoint.

6 months or so ago I started to get really dizzy and the dizzieness is almost everyday. It's worse with movements. Sometimes it feels like i'm walking on a boat or trampoline.

Went to go do some yoga and within the first minute I am extremely dizzy and my arms and legs are falling asleep. Legs straight out, they fall asleep. Childs pose legs are asleep. Crossing my arms over my chest, they fall asleep. I've read people having problems with their extremities falling asleep but everything I've read was at the 30 minute mark or longer...not a minute in.

Have any of you experienced anything like this? I cant do any other form of exercise because its just too hard on my body. I want to get back to yoga, but I cant handle the immediate dizzieness or limbs falling alseep."

yoga,I'm in love with Yin!,"I just wanted to share my love story with Yoga Yin 🤍 

I (41F) have always been sporty and active with a hyper, intense, impulsive personality also struggling with overthinking issues... Constantly trying to channel my messy brain and working a lot on myself! With some personal work, years and life experiences, i slowly learned how to be more peaceful and tolerant but still far from any true wisdom or full self-control!

During Covid, i got stuck overseas in basic conditions with a new partner and far from my life... I was in survival mode and held the depression. I lost motivation to practice any activity and was totally sedentary for 2 years. 

When life slowly came back to normal i tried to find some motivation again and forced myself to do simple training but it was awful... Then a few months ago i randomly installed a yoga app and started with the basics of Vinyasa and Ashtanga. I am not flexible and lost all my strength so it was hard, but i enjoyed learning and rapidly started to feel some improvements :)  And then, by chance, while checking the other options on the App i discovered Yoga Yin and it was immediately a perfect match! 

I am a beginner and train myself alone at home with an App so i don't know about any technical vocabulary, scientific explanation or so... But Yin is for me something truly incredible! It reduced the stiffness in my whole body (i got extremely stiff with back pain since lockdown) and it achieves amazing results with my brain. I struggle to meditate properly but during a Yin session i get into this kind of meditation stage, naturally and easily, my mind simply disconnects. It feels like with each hold, when i release the tension, i also release some hormones which purifies my body and brain! I do 1 hour right out of the bed in the morning and another session in the late afternoon. During the day i also do another 40min of Vinyasa or Ashtanga (for the cardio and strength). And whenever i feel losing myself and start to overthink and be gloomy, i just throw a 15-30min session of Yin and i'm all cleanse! I hope it will last because for now it's purely magical and i never felt so much balanced and peaceful... 

Voila, i just wanted to share this... 🙏"

I have experience with yoga classes, videos, etc.. but nothing serious. May not know the name of poses even if i've done them a bunch type deal.

I have looked around youtube and this subreddit and I have found some good info, including the down dog app.

Still, I remain with questions. Some things I am looking for:
* Short (preferably 10-15, no longer than 20 min if possible)
* Flexibility and stretching focused, I don't mind some strength but I find it aggravating when pushups or squats are incorporated often into a routine.
* On a similar note, not interested in pure meditation without a pose, also have that covered outside of yoga.

I am always trying new things, to see what works best, but I hope that yall will help me speed things into finding more efficient routines. Even just suggesting what to try on down dog app maybe.

Anyways, tell me if my askings are too much or where I could find these types of routines.

yoga,What is the incense used in yoga studios?,"Sorry if this is vague.

I have always been obsessed with the incense I occasionally smell in various yoga studios I’ve been to. I always forget to ask and it’s not always burned.

But when a teacher burns incense, it’s ALWAYS this scent. And I love it and need it for my home. 

I smelt it in a store, got excited, and asked. Bought a pack and went home. It was not the scent, I think the saleswoman did not the scent they were burning and just told me jasmine. It is not jasmine. Also it is not nag champa. When I google, I come up with potentially Palo santo wood but I have never smelled it in a store so I don’t know until I might order it"

I have been practicing yoga on and off for 20+ years. One trend, that I find distracting, are yoga class students taking their own practice, while the rest of us are trying to follow the yoga teacher. In every class I attend, there seem to be at least 1 or 2.   


I am referring to people who throw in all sorts of twists, chair poses, balancing poses etc. when the teacher is taking the class through a rudimentary Sun A for warm up.

I am the only guy, and I get really sweaty. I understand it’s hot yoga and sweat is going to happen. But I am dripping all over and by the end there are little pools around my mat. It seems like all the other people (30-50 year old women) have got it way under control while I’m a sweaty mess. I’m fit and not working too hard, I just sweat a lot I guess.

I feel self conscious about this and like I am a gross annoyance to the class. If you are grossed out by sweaty guys in your class please let me know, I’d honestly rather not go if I am bothering the studio or other people in the class."

The reason for this is: We’re in a time period where we can diversify our needs so widely (thanks to tech, travel options, access to information etc.)... In the past we were limited to social networks based on our villages, neighborhoods, countries etc. where our social role was embedded since birth.

Because information is so widely accessible where we can work and shape ourselves exactly the way we want. We are able to come out of old patterns and flourish as individuals, become something completely new.

Work on your core wounds, come deep into your self and take action to unfold your plan begin to work through your karma.

yoga,Thoughts on a delicate situation?,"My partner and I take a hot yoga class and had a really uncomfortable experience that we are unsure how to handle. Let me preface this by saying that I feel like your yoga practice is your own- you do you and I'm not judging. 

Recently, we've had two classes where we both left feeling uncomfortable and that our practice was seriously disrupted. A few moments into class, before anything strenuous, we heard behind us very loud moaning. At first I thought, maybe someone just got a really good stretch in. However, the moaning got louder and continued through every single pose, including savasana. Without getting explicit, it sounded extremely sexual in nature. I understand breathing is an important part of yoga, but this was incredibly loud and began to pull us out of our flow and concentration. Eventually, the instructor turned up the music to try and drown it out, but at that point we were unable to hear the cues over both the music and the moaning. 

How would you all react to this? Just find a new class? Say something to the studio? I absolutely love this class and hate to give it up, but at this point, I'm getting nothing out of it."
yoga,Tool for alternate nostril breathing/Plugging one nostril shut,"Hey,  
what would you use to plug one nostril?   


I lost my medical silicone nose plug and due to a medical condition I cant breath through my left nostril except when my right nostril is closed. As some of you may know, the left nostril is more conducive to a relaxed state of body and mind. Any ideas what I could use as a makeshift?  


This all might sound rather unimportant to you, but to me it is very relevant to keep balance in my life.

yoga,Interested in yoga retreat following college graduation,"I'm a 21 y/o female college grad looking to further my practice on a retreat in some beautiful destination. **Where should I look to pursue such a trip**, and are there any retreats that would attract a crowd of a similar demographic / interest to me? My studio is not offering any during the summer unfortunately. I've been practicing for several years, daily for the past few months, at a hot vinyasa studio and would say I am intermediate/advanced in my skills, if that's relevant."
yoga,Should I quit my job at the gym?,"So backstory: I work at a gym as a team member. I wanted to work at a gym bc I want a free membership as they’re expensive + they offer Yoga &amp; Pilates classes, which I love.

I’m looking at other jobs that pay more though and I had considered just working 2-3 days at the gym to keep my benefits but $1-$3 more per hour makes me wonder if it’s even worth it to stay. I truly only enjoy my classes (as my schedule is packed always) but they only offer vinyasa yoga every other day or pilates classes (rarely at a farther location). This might not be the right sub for this but is it worth staying or should I find my (affordable) yoga (&amp; pilates less so) instruction elsewhere?"
yoga,Yet another Malasana issue,"Hello. I’ve been doing yoga just about every day for 8ish months. I’m slowly becoming more flexible and do see lots of improvement. When I’m malasana, I can only put my heals down when my toes are pointed completely outward. Meaning my feet are basically in a straight line with one another. I feel comfortable in the pose and there is no knee or hip pain. I’m able to keep my back straight, but I do feel unsteady in the pose. It definitely doesn’t look “normal “ when I do this and I’m not sure if it’s good to do it like this just so my heels can touch the ground. Instructors in class usually check in about it, and when I tell them it’s the only way I can get my heels in the ground, they just kinda say okay and move on. I’ve tried to look into why this is, and I find so many different answers, but I’m starting to feel like it’s just the way my hips are. Anybody have any experience with this? Any advice would be appreciated."

When my partner took one of my classes, he pointed out that the ""head over your heart, heart over your pelvis"" postural cue (intended to support a tall spine) doesn't make sense because your heart is more to the left than central.

I make $45 an hour teaching yoga. and $40 an hour as a hygienist. If I quit my day job I’d make more teaching yoga but cannot imagine teaching 7 hours a day 5 days a week.

yoga,alternative to sitting cross-legged?,"TLDR; Pain around outside of ankle, fiancé had ankle surgery on same side, tips or alternatives to avoid pain when sitting cross-legged.

Hi. I know I'm not very active on here, mostly because I haven't been able to enjoy my practice for the past year due to my fiancé getting pregnant and then having ankle reconstructive surgery. 

Today, however, was my first day getting back to yoga. I started with Yoga with Adrienne, her 30 day challenge as I find it a good kick in the butt when I haven't been active in a while. However, during my practice I noticed the outside of my ankle, where the ankle meets the foot (if memory serves me right it's the Anterior Tibiofibular) that area begins to hurt and become sore. Now ironically this is the same place my fiancé had surgery done.

 So my question is, are there any alternatives to sitting cross-legged that me and my fiancé can do until we build up our ankles to be able to sit cross-legged?

And fyi so I'm not violating any rules, I am not seeking Medical Advice. Just alternatives to sitting."
yoga,Has anyone heard of yoga bringing back depression?,"I tried a yoga class for the first time about a week ago, and immediately after the class, I noticed old feelings and thoughts from around 7 years ago, including suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self harm. I figured it must have been me bottling up the feelings in muscle tension, and the yoga releasing it so that I could actually deal with it properly. Which I thought I did, and so I did some more yoga the next day (which I'm really really enjoying, despite what I've just said). But then I got more depressed, and think it's likely here to stay a while. It really feels like my old depression has returned and not changed at all. 

Has anyone heard of anything like this happening? Or is it probably just a coincidence of timing? I tried to Google it, but only found results about yoga helping with depression. I have heard about emotions getting stuck in the muscles and then released in yoga/massages before, but not to this extent.

I'm still doing and enjoying the yoga, and think it's doing me good even if it's unearthing issues like this."

yoga,Yoga type: Kundalini - What is it and Why should you practice it? My experience.,"I wanted to talk about the type of yoga I personally have had experience with, Kundalini.  There are many different schools of yoga and obviously most of you are only to have time to try one.  Rather than expunge the facts of what others believe Kundalini does for them, here's what I believe it has done for me:

Kundalini Yoga for me has been a spiritual vehicle of emotional healing and release.  The promise of Kundalini Yoga help you facilitate spiritual growth and emotional transformation, to reach peace.  In the 8 years I have done it, I definitely feel that Kundalini Yoga has lived up to this promise.  Kundalini Yoga to me is less about the mechanics of 'fit and flexible' and more of the mechanics of emotional health.  One great example I always like to talk about is anger:  If someone is in traffic and cuts you off suddenly you probably will be feeling the darkness of anger even if you tell yourself you don't want to feel it - and yet you do anyway.  That's the truth of many of our interactions.  Truth is, our emotions just happen no matter what we put in their way.  The anger I often felt in life would pop up and lash out at people undeserving of its wrath.  And truth is, I didn't anyone to be a party to that negativity.  After a few months of Kundalini Yoga, I began to notice that burden was being lifted.  Many of you may want to NOT be angry, but chances are you've noticed it comes anyway.  This is the burden of your darkness, a burden that I discovered, you may lift.

You can find a lot about the benefits of Kundalini Yoga.  Anger is my most popular example because it's something among the normal hosts of emotions that most of us often recognize as a regular part of our day.  I often thought that regularly feeling that awful darkness that comes from anger was simply a part of life I had to live with.  My spiritual journey taught me that it is in fact the experience of overcoming, in a sense, the darkness of anger, and feeling the joy of liberation was also a part of my plan.  The entire spectrum of human emotions is covered, not just anger.  I'm just a regular person with nothing exceptional or special about him.  I'm a poor fit for yoga as my fitness and flexibility is terrible (still is).  But even for me, there was the realized potential to fulfill the promise of Kundalini Yoga - to be free of my emotional darkness.

My experience with Kundalini Yoga continued past just my experience of anger.  It was like the way I felt about things was transformed.  Imagine something that you feel that bothers you all day.  Now imagine that you only have to feel it for about 10-20 minutes?  Not only do I feel and process things quicker, but the weight of those things is truly a feather vs a barbell.  That's the emotional comparison of the weight of things I now carry vs the way I used to carry them.  That's the scope of Kundalini Yoga.  It doesn't change who you are as a person, it changes your experience of things for the better.  If you're a kleptomaniac who steals things for thrills, this isn't going to put you on the straight and narrow.  But you won't be worrying incessantly about getting caught or obsessing whether the store is going to trace the theft back to you.  I like to think of it as an upgrade to your entire emotional dynamic, by a few levels.  It lets you enjoy things, without so much burdensome darkness that wretches us all throughout the day.

Kundalini Yoga promises many other things, some specifically related to the energy of a quantum technology called 'Kundalini'.  I could tell you about these things - they're important but they are subtle and some of them are advanced things I haven't gotten into yet.  I can't speak to that end too much and so I won't.  You can read about them.  Some of them I feel I realized, but I never had a dramatic Kundalini awakening or any experience that really says, ""Welcome to Kundalini Energy!""  As I understand it, the energy may actually be part of my emotional transformation, and if so, I have definitely realized that part of the promise of Kundalini as an energy within.  If you research it further, you will discover things like it works with the 7 chakras.  If that seems a little foreign, don't worry.  You don't need to understand what chakras are to benefit from it.  Think of the chakras as glorified labels for common emotional dynamics in your life, a way to classify certain things.  You don't need to know how to directly work with chakras, the practices take care of that.    

To sum up, mostly what you can look forward to is dramatic emotional healing and transformation.  The movements themselves are simple movements, some mantras, nothing too scary.  If you're already into yoga you might find it pretty easy compared to other schools.  It might be a vehicle into other spiritual practices you may liken to which I wholely encourage.  Spirituality culture is full of things that might scare regular people off.  I feel like I should apologize to all regular people because of that.  You don't need to study a whole lot of what is written in books to embrace spiritual practices.  Things like Kundalini Yoga, and meditation can all be really accessible to the regular non-spirituality-culture-interested person.  Spiritual culture often says a lot about a lot of subjects and most regular people run away from that.  But the treasure is definitely found in spiritual practices, which I believe is one of the great true treasures from the history of spirituality on our world.

I have done all my yoga as home practices, as Kundalini Yoga is not widely available in my country (USA).  I've used Maya Fiennes mostly and she is the only teacher I often recommend.  I like recommending her because her practices are well paced and good for beginners without too many scary elements for non-spiritual people.  Things you might find most strange if you aren't used to it are chanting mantras out loud, which are simple vibrations to help facilitate change.  I have found real value in chanting these.  At a certain level of awareness you can actually perceive the energy generated from saying these mantras.  You can occasionally find her practices on YouTube (which often get removed) but the really good one (Journey through the Chakras) only on torrent sites or through her official web site.

For me, the transformation was quite incredible and I often try to lead those who suffer to the path of Kundalini Yoga.  I only talk about this type of yoga because I have experienced how it removed awful darkness from my life and replaced it with feelings of peace and tranquility, and the ability to handle suffering without having my entire day become all about what I'm going through.  It is quite worth it to look into it.  Keen an open mind about what you may read, because a lot of it is true.  You might not be ready to fully accept this existence of chakras or certain spiritual concepts, but everyone can benefit from Kundalini Yoga emotionally.  There is no prerequisite to benefit, only the determination to bring more joy into your life and liberate yourself from the negativity and darkness that every human experiences.  That is what Kundalini Yoga excels at.

I hope you all find peace.  This is my experience with this school of yoga and if you choose to practice Kundalini Yoga I wish you well."

yoga,Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and floaty knee caps help when stretching hips!,"Hey everyone! I’ve been regularly practicing yoga for about 2 months now, but this is not my first rodeo with it. I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and my kneecaps are very unstable, I.e. they don’t stay in one place. I can easily pick up my knee caps and move them. 

I need to stretch out my hips as I have low back injuries and tons of problems with my hip flexors. The only issue, my favorite stretches like Pigeon pose, cause knee issues. When I have my leg back, and my knee is against the ground, I can feel my kneecap moving and sliding around. It’s not painful but very uncomfortable. 

I’m assuming this is probably not very good for my knees in the long run so I’m wondering if anyone has any suggestions? Should I just resort to my bulky knee braces? Are there exercises to help keep the knee cap from taking off? I can’t do KT tape bc I’m allergic to the adhesive sticky stuff :/ help plz?"
yoga,Super tight in hips and hamstrings leading to back pain?,"I've tried doing yoga before and it was nice, except the stretches hurt so bad in my legs, hips, and back. I did it for about a week and it just got progressively worse so I just kinda stopped. 

I was wondering if there's a way to get past that to hopefully become flexible. I stretch after lifting weights and it only seems to make it so it doesn't get worse it doesn't improve it. It's a solid 7 minutes of stretches focused on my hips and legs, then another 7 minutes on my upper body shoulders and arms. So it's not like it's a quick 20 second stretch. I'm actively trying. 

This really sucks though. It's been this way ever since I can remember. I'm only 27 and I feel like I should be a lot more flexible then I am. I've had the issue since I was 18 or younger tho, I struggle to even sit criss cross, my knees are way up in the air for it to be comfortable. Looks awkward lol"
yoga,Kundalini yoga recommendation,"Hi! I am new to kundalini yoga and my studio has two classes of kundalini per month. I love it but I don’t find enough resources on youtube.

yoga,Hypermobility syndrome but can’t fully touch my toes,"I’m new to yoga but previously did taekwondo where we usually have to do stretching exercises like Butterfly stretch, forward cold, splits etc. 

I was told that I had hypermobility syndrome at a young age as my knees bend backwards more than what’s considered to be normal. I’m also able to do the butterfly stretch with little to no pain/ tugging at all. My butterfly stretches are so stretched out that my sensei would stand on my thighs and push me down but id barely feel any pain/ tugging.

However, I can just about touch my toes but I know for yoga there are poses where your palms have to be flat on the ground. I have issues with basic poses like downward dog. That’s really adding to the “imposter syndrome” feeling in me when I’m in a room full of super fit people who can at the very least can do the downward dog perfectly. 

Any suggestions? Anyone else have hypermobility syndrome, if so how did it affect you doing yoga?"

yoga,Seeking to understand the funny feeling when I do wheel pose,"I used to be a gymnast and don’t remember this happening. Now, when I do the wheel, I get this funny feeling that is so difficult to describe. It is so intense and it intensifies the longer I’m in the pose, so I can only hold it for like 10 seconds. I don’t know if it’s approaching a coregasm or total collapse. It kind of feels like it tickles, and I feel it in my feet, hamstrings, and uterus. As soon as I exit the bridge, the sensations subside. I’ve actually felt a similar feeling doing sphinx pose a couple times, but it is reliable and predictable when I do wheel pose. I’m just curious if anyone else experiences this, what it is, what causes it, etc."

yoga,"What is your favourite or rather, “hero” yoga asana?","TLDR: I love the frog pose. Which is your favourite asana, that may or may not be a tough one, but really makes you feel like a million bucks?

Description: 

I just really love the frog pose. It makes me feel a tiny bit special within my heart in every yoga class. 

The first time I tried it, I was 30 kgs overweight and most poses were hard for me. I felt so inadequate compared to the other people in the yoga class. 

And then the instructor moved us into frog and lo and behold! My hips opened like they had been doing it forever; so much so that I didn’t even realise it’s supposed to be an advanced pose. I was chilling there, wondering if I am supposed to feel a stretch anywhere. 

Other people were staring, including the instructor, who told me I am incredibly flexible in the hips. The girl next to me actually clapped and asked in awe if I have any hip bones at all.

So it’s my hero pose, the one I do for comfort and encouragement in my journey towards becoming the best and fittest version of myself."

&amp;#x200B;

Beginner Yoga enthusiast here. I have been practicing Yoga for a good 5 months right now consistently. I have fallen in love with it and it is an activity that makes me really happy. However, I have been having this problem with a Yogi's butt.

&amp;#x200B;

I have these flareups on my sacrum/buttocks that are annoying and don't let me practice for a good 3-4 days. I have gone to a doctor and PT and they diagnosed it as potentially a gluteal strain (for which I rested for 3 weeks). **However, I keep getting these flareups, especially for folding poses (think of holding during sun salutations and head-to-knee poses.), despite working out diligently for my core and lower body (also an avid weight lifter)**. Interestingly poses like a pyramid, pigeon, or downward dog cause me no pain and no bother.

&amp;#x200B;

I originally thought it was overuse (I used to practice 5 times a week in a row). I have lowered it to 3-4 with at least a day of rest in between to give rest to my tendons. **If I don't do any folding movements i just get no pain whatsoever. I just don't know how to work on my flexibility if I can't do those poses.** I am seeing a new PT in two weeks but I am seeking some crowd knowledge from you guys!"

yoga,Building strength?,"Hello all. I have been practicing yoga 4-6 days a week for 9 months. I follow Yoga With Adriene as well as The Underbelly, recently trying out Alomoves. Before that I used to practice yoga weekly for years in college where I took a lot of in person classes so I have a pretty good understanding of alignment. Be that as it may, after these 9 months I have not gotten much stronger, or more flexible. Basic poses still feel so hard on me, such as downward dog, lunges, plank, and anything that involves balancing on one leg. My transitions are still clunky, and I sweat and lose my breath during beginner vinyasa flows. It makes it very hard to motivate myself to do yoga each morning because I feel I have not made much physical progress even though I've been consistent. It's frustrating because I want to try more intermediate poses, the beginner vinyasa flows are feeling a bit boring to me. How long does it take for foundational poses to feel natural? How can I build strength and stamina? Should I be digging in deeper and doing longer practices or backing off and taking a rest? 

Full disclosure; I realize yoga is more than just physical. I breathe and meditate as well and I do more gentle practices on days I'm feeling tired. I'm not religious or spiritual so I am really doing yoga only for the physical benefits and I'm not looking for spiritual advice."
yoga,Choosing a Meditation Pillow,"Hi! 

I'm getting a meditation cushion soon, and I'm looking for some input on the best size, shape, and material. 

Most importantly, I'm plus sized and have an epic booty, so I'm concerned with ensuring the pillow is large enough to use comfortably. 

I've looked at some yoga blocks, since they'd be multifunctional, but the ones that are made of foam seem like they'd be too hard, and I'm concerned about the firmness of buckwheat or memory foam, and how they might hold up over time. I don't want to squish it out.

Finally, price is a concern, I'm on a budget, so any good and cheap recommendations would be excellent. I generally prefer to shop online through prime but will support a worthy cause. 

Thanks in advance for your help!"
yoga,Yoga is always ready for your return.,"Hi everyone! I will try to keep this short, but I would like to share my experience with yoga for the last year or so.

I started practicing yoga around this time a year ago. I was really struggling mentally (and due to that, also physically). I was in desperate need of finding something grounding, comforting, but also challenging to focus my brain on. 

I joined this subreddit and posted here occasionally. Everyone was incredibly helpful and welcoming and I truly felt like I finally found movement (and spiritual connection as well) that I could fully commit to. And I did - I started practicing every single day. I woke up at 4am and practiced for 1 hour every morning. I tried everything - Vinyasa, Hatha, Ashtanga, Yin Yoga. I stuck with Vinyasa because it was like cardio and I was able to get my sweat on. 

Unfortunately, my mindset was not in the right place. Since I have an eating disorder (and I’m sorry if this triggers anyone, I won’t use any descriptive or detailed language), I subconsciously began using yoga as a way to burn calories. My practice no longer satisfied me nor comforted me. If I missed one day of practice, everything was ruined - my progress especially, I felt disconnected from myself and out of control. 

I stopped practicing altogether in December. I couldn’t stick to my daily practice, I could barely go for 20 minutes without feeling exhausted and in pain. I knew that my practice wasn’t supposed to be like that - that I wasn’t supposed to be miserable. 

I took a break from yoga to focus on my recovery. It was (and still is) a very shaky road and I have a very long journey ahead, but four days ago, I finally felt the familiar pull I experienced a year ago. (It was partially because my posture has gotten worse, my back and joints started hurting again, as well)

I rolled out my mat and barely got through a 30 minutes practice. I was absolutely exhausted, but at the same time, I felt like I was reborn. Physically, I’m definitely nowhere near what I could do a couple months ago, but the body remembers and I can definitely see progress after just 4 days of practice. I know I will soon be where I was and continue where I left off (which is perfecting my chaturanga and pulling off the crow pose lol) 

My original mindset is back, just like that. I didn’t need anyone (not even myself) to “force me” back into practice. It just happened. I realised yoga never really left my life. I never “abandoned” my practice. It was always there, waiting for me to come back. And I’m really, really glad I was able to do that. 

Have a wonderful day/night, fellow yogis. And good luck in your practice! &lt;3"
yoga,Learning Yoga as DHH,"👋 Hello, all! I'm a late deafening/hearing impaired person who is interested in learning yoga. I want to use yoga as part of a healthy fitness plan but also to help calm my mind. I dont speak ASL yet but I do wear hearing aids in both ears. The problem is that with my type of hearing, sound is imbalanced (one side is worse than the other but both are pretty bad) and I dont always process sound/words correctly. For instance if instructions are being given but my head is down, I might hear something but have no idea what was said or I can very easily get it wrong. What are my honest chances of learning yoga without hurting myself? Is there a way to go about finding a deaf friendly teacher? Obviously DHH people learn yoga, I just dont know how to get started. Thanks✌️"
yoga,Why did my yoga instructor block me and should I go back to their class?,"I have been going to yoga classes with this one instructor for a couple of months now, and I love their classes \`- they employ a much more spiritual approach than other instructors, which I really vibe with.

After class one day, they mention how they will be hosting free classes outside of the institution, and to follow them on social media for more details, so I followed them.  Recently, they posted on social media about hosting a free yoga class over zoom, so I replied asking for the zoom link.  They sent it, and I joined, sat in the waiting room for a while, and then right as the meeting started, I got a notification that said ""The host has removed you from this meeting.""  
I wrote a message to my instructor explaining that I had been kicked, but that my sister and I would be interested in attending the next free yoga session, however, they had already blocked me by that point.  
I was always very respectful, kept it at a student-teacher relationship, the only times I would approach them is when I would ask for advice on specific poses I needed help with; it's not like I was DMing them on social media or flirting with them after yoga..  So not sure where things went South??  I am kind of at a loss for words, because they were the only instructor that I felt comfortable with, they had such uplifting classes, and really hit the spiritual aspect that I sought in yoga.

Do I still sign up for their classes and maybe talk to them to see what's up, or is this a sign from them that they don't want me coming to their classes anymore?"

yoga,"How beginner friendly are ""all levels"" classes?","I've started doing yoga with Youtube videos recently, and I really enjoy it. I would like to attend some in person classes, but none of the studios near me offer beginner classes- just ""all levels"" or ""beginner friendly"" at best.  

I'm generally okay looking like an idiot while I try something new but I just feel like being amongst other beginners would be a much more comfortable experience. If we were talking about say, a 5 minute trip to ""all levels"" or 25 minutes for a beginner class, which would you recommend I try?"
yoga,how does it feel to practice yoga with the same group for years,"This month our teacher started insisting a lot on synchronizing our movements with our breath. She had mentioned this before but this time she also mentioned to pay attention to the other students' breath too, in case we forgot to pay attention to our breath. Which got me wondering, could a long lasting group of yoga practitioners eventually start to synchronize their breath during the practice? Is that a thing? Or that's too far fetched? If you have practicing yoga with the same group for years, what has been your experience?"

I do yoga pretty much daily at my studio and still just don't even feel like my hips have any more space than they did when I started months ago. Any suggestions from my tight hip gang?"
yoga,Yoga for neck?,"As I have got older - and spending most of my day sat in front of a computer and writing - I have found that my neck has become stiffer and less flexible.

I can remember only a few years ago I could turn my head left and right further back. I could tilt my head back much further.

And now I am getting a 'pinched' feeling between my shoulder blades.

I am doing yoga regularly but I would really like to do yoga exercises to help me unstiffen my neck and become more fluid and flexible.

I keep waiting for those telltale 'pops' and 'cracks' in my neck/spine to tell me my neck is loosening up but not happening...

Can anyone help me with some good videos or exercises I should try in yoga to help with stiff, old man neck?

Many thanks!"
yoga,Planning a Daily Yoga Routine,"Hello :)

yoga,In terms of mental conditioning how is moving through asanas different from pure meditation? They don't seem all that different.,"Asana practice:

1. Assume position
2. Choose object of focus (drishti/mula bandha/visualization)
3. Maintain open awareness so you can catch your mind wandering off of the object
4. Move to next position

Meditation:

1. Assume position
2. Choose object of focus (breath, sensation, or visualization)
3. Maintain open awareness so you can catch your mind wandering off of the object
4. Maintain position

In terms of mental conditioning, what exactly is the difference here? I suppose pure meditation can be done for longer because your body would be less likely to tire out, but if you're only going to practice for 45 minutes or less and your body can handle the extra strain there doesn't seem to be that much of a difference from a mental standpoint."

yoga,Confusion about core activation with positions on the back," I’ve heard some conflicting things in regards to core activations during positions that have you on your back.

 I looked up how to activate your core and it mentioned keep your spine neutral with it’s natural curve. 
 The article mentioned you should be able to put a hand under your back but not arch it. But in some videos I’ve watched I’m told along the lines “Press your lower back into the ground.” and when I do this the best I can to my understanding, I’m losing the natural curve my spine has and can’t place a hand under it.

 I’m not sure if maybe I read some misinformation or didn’t understand the verbal cue I was given.

 A lot of things will come along the way if we decide to do this, however recently I have been really into adopting healthy habits again, working out consistently, fixed my diet and practicing yoga daily. I'm very pumped up about this because I am finally in a very good track of feeling and actually being the healthiest I've been. 
My concern would be that if I did happen to become pregnant I won't be able to stick to my goals especially postpartum since it can be physically demanding and my body will change so much. 
Did you continue to practice while pregnant? How did you manage to hop back to your previous routines after giving birth?Did it take long before going back to your old yoga practice and reaching the same level of physical ability? Did you manage to maintain any kind of schedule for yourself? The arrival of the baby can be pretty demanding and it seems that life getting in the way will make it difficult to bounce back."

yoga,Thoughts on transitioning to down dog app from YWA?,"Apologies in advance for the lengthy post…

I’ve been dabbling in yoga on &amp; off for a couple years, doing YWA, Yoga with Kassandra, or Peloton yoga classes here and there (I took Bikram classes for awhile several years ago as well). A few ago I committed to doing Kassandra’s 30 day bedtime yin program and the change in my mental state was incredible so I’ve continued to repeat the program over and over since. Two months ago I committed to also starting a daily practice in the morning to work on my flexibility. I’m approaching the end of my second consecutive YWA 30 day program and want to progress into something good a little more advanced. I’ve seen mixed feedback on this sub about the transition from YWA to the Down Dog app and it being quite a jump in difficulty and some people even getting injured  

My question is: what are everyone’s thoughts on moving my morning practices to Down Dog vs. using Peloton and/or Kassandra’s videos?

And if I do move to Down Dog what level is recommended? I’ve certainly done more than 10 classes of online counts and I can do crow pose, but I’m really apprehensive about picking a level where I might injure / or reinjure myself (herniated my L5/S1 twice in my 20s from lower body muscle imbalances).

TLDR: After 60 days of YWA should I move to Down Dog app or stick to Yoga with Kassandra and/or Peloton yoga?"

yoga,Yoga after cervical spine surgery?,"Started practicing at a local studio back in beginning of 2021 about 2 to 3x per week and loved it. A few months ago I started getting shoulder and arm pain that forced me to stop all activity. Eventually, was sent for an MRI and quickly diagnosed with a number of cervical spine issues, with the most pressing (no pun intended) being a severely compressed spinal cord.  Multiple surgeons have seen me and commented that they can't believe I am in the physical shape I'm in in terms of balance, strength, not paralyzed, given my MRI. That's the good part and I attribute a lot of that to yoga, but the bad part is I have to get surgery or else I risk losing fine motor skills, balance, and even paralysis. 

I'm told I can resume full activity as soon as 2 months after surgery, but there is debate among surgeons (I'm heading for a third opinion tomorrow) about the recommended surgical approach - hybrid fusion+discs vs all fusions. As you can imagine, I've been quite bummed. For a couple of months the pain was debilitating and I couldn't even \*walk\* without the pain flaring up. Finally have that under control but any real physical activity is forbidden due to the risk of further compressing my spine. 

Has anyone here had cervical spine fusion/hybrid and can share their experience in coming back to yoga? As I mentioned, one surgeon said ""2 months but it depends"" and another said likely 4 months and maybe longer."

I have gotten an X-ray that didn't show any physical deformities and wne through a round of PT that did not work. Beyond this my doctor and PT seem to be at a loss for what to do next.

My knee pain tends to be the worst when I am not active (it gets better when I play sports or workout) so I am starting to think that it may be due to some muscle imbalance/tightness. 

I am reasonably strong but I am MISERABLEY inflexible so I'm guessing this could be part of the cause for me knee pain.

I have done yoga a few times before, and love the way it makes me feel (even though I am not very good at it lol), so I'm going to start doing yoga more regularly to see of it addresses my knee pain. 

My question is, has anyone had knee pain that got much better from yoga? And if so, what kind of yoga were you doing....etc.

yoga,Any g o o d books?,"I want to learn about chakras and yoga for awhile, because it's the best model I could find to help me with certain long term problems I have. I wanted to find a solution that could really help, not just something temporary. I like how it's organize, how things hard to grasp are clearly represented. We're all different and there's no magic solution to all our problems, yet what we learn with chakras and yoga could be applied to all of us (as individuals) and be beneficial. I trully believe what we lack is balance and harmony so things flow, and it starts from whithin. At least for me, a physical, mental and spiritual balance is what I'm trying to achieve, so I can give more back to the world (because I need to in order to feel ok to be alive). I need a plan to get started, and finally doing something else other than ""look it up and think about it"".

But I never got into these things, because of the consequences of cultural appropriation.
All I can find about chakras and yoga make me cringe, it feels like the off-brand of what I'm really looking for. 3/4 of the sites I visited were giving me only the superficial explanation of these practices, the western-pollished version. The ""here's a product, use it and problem solved!"" version. That's not how I'll solve my problem. There's something missing, something doesn't feel right.

I'd like to understand how people came up with this structure. And why. How can I apply something created thousands of years ago to my life today in 2022? Why it got created: to solve the same kind of problem I'm having. Humans tend to do that, repeating mistakes for millennia. But to what point can I really applied this to my life and how?

So my question is... any good books?"

yoga,"Thoughts on the more ""woohoo"" or pseudoscience aspects of yoga?","I'm in the middle of my 200 yoga training and I'm really enjoying all I'm learning so far, especially diving into the philosophy of the yoga sutras. I'm struggling a bit with some aspects, though. 

The chakras and the entire concept of Ayruveda are really new to me and I'm trying to stay open minded, but Ayruveda especially seems just... not real. We determined our doshas using essentially Buzzfeed quizzes and the idea that I should dramatically change my lifestyle based on being 1 of 3 of these doshas seems both wildly simplistic and also far too complicated. 

The chakras are more accessible to me because it seems like they are based on the locations of glands in the body, but so far I haven't been able to find any books, articles, or podcasts that dive into this aspect of the chakras. 

Other participants in my class also believe in crystals and Reiki. I'm not NOT a believer, but I am a strong sceptic and I'm wondering if anyone here can point me in the direction of facts here?

Does anyone else try to do yoga with eyes closed? If yes what has been your experience,  

I don’t know if this means anything, but I have a very strong glasses/contact prescription, I was born like this. It’s more difficult to do yoga if I am not wearing my contacts.

It’s very important that I learn how to do this, considering I am kind of preparing on going blind, at some point in my life. Unless technology improves drastically."

How do you all get over this feeling?"
yoga,How long usually takes to mastering a new pose?,"I saw a dramatic improvement in my flexibility. Along with it came tears. From being to barely able to hold a bridge pose, I was able to hold a wheel in a year."
yoga,People who do yoga each day with no instructor (whether online or in person classes) how did you progress do this stage?,I always see people in movies doing yoga in their backyard with nothing to tell them what pose next or how long to hold the poses and always wounded how many people in real life actually do this. How does one get to this stage- is it just years of practice? And how often would you change the routine or progress to more advanced moves?
yoga,Relieving pain for my well endowed yogis?,"I love yoga, it’s helped me with a lot of day to day pain. I have a pretty heavy chest, 48DD.

I really don’t want a breast reduction but I’m feeling like it might have to happen if I want a more painless lifestyle."

yoga,Ashtanga Yoga with right hip pain,"Hi folks,

I've been doing ashtanga on off for about 8 years--maybe more, and mostly off. It's been a few years since I've done the primary sequence. 

I love the flow aspect of ashtanga, and I want to restart my practice. However, I wanted to know if any ashtangis have experienced right hip pain (or any hip pain, really) during their practice and if they have any tips for how I can adjust the hip heavy asanas to support myself? 

Or, are there other types of flow yoga which you folks might recommend?"
yoga,Is it true that becoming a Yoga instructor will make you many new friends?,"Recently I moved to a new city and am looking to meet new friends.

I've gotten back into Yoga but mostly people at the studio just come and go (not much chance to make friends).

Will becoming an instructor be a way to make friends from Yoga?

Thanks!"
yoga,I am strong &amp; empowered.,"I've done a few challenges like taking cold showers for months, using an old Nokia N97 instead of an iPhone, working as an electrician for more than half a decade, cycling about 125km a week to school for a year &amp; yet that was the hardest thing I've done so far:  


One hour of power yoga every day, for a total of 108 days, focusing on something different every day of the week. (PY108 by Inner Dimension TV).  
At the beginning of the year I started this challenge with my girlfriend during the holidays. I had never really liked yoga, maybe because I was as flexible as a piece of steel.  


The very physically demanding power yogas like strength &amp; cardio were intense, but the real challenge were the classes like yin and balance. An hour while stretching or balancing, trying to stay present and not get lost in thought again.  


Today is the 108th day, we did it."
yoga,"How to interpret / distinguish the body sensations of tingling, fuzziness, pins and needles, TV snow, etc.,","Hi, I've been practicing yoga for some time now, and trying to learn how I can better understand the sensations in my body, and what they are telling me.

There are some postures where I'll experience tingling in some parts of my body. If I leave the posture, it goes away. There are a variety of sensations possible, and many words that describe them: tingling, electricity, pins and needles, fuzziness, TV snow, ""that feeling before your leg goes numb"" et cetera., ...

I had a yoga teacher tell me early on that tingling was a sign of nerve stuff, and to back out immediately; no amount of tingling is safe. I had another yoga teacher tell me recently that a little bit of low-intensity tingling is fine, especially if you are sitting in a posture for some minutes, and the tingling doesn't start right away.

I had a third instructor tell me that there are different types of tingling, depending on if there is a nerve issue, or if you are restricting bloodflow by being in a pose; and that the bloodflow one is usually OK if it's not for too long.

I would like to put it out to the /r/yoga community, what do you know about the tingling sensation? Does it happen to you? How do you distinguish between the different types of tingling or other sensations, and what they mean?"

yoga,Hot Yoga - Beginner,"Hey! 
I am relatively new to yoga and have been doing 2x hot yoga sessions and 1x yoga relax class each week.
I have been going for month now and have noticed I easily fatigue in the hot yoga class. I used to be a dancer so flexibility is not an issue but it’s just keeping up with it all. I regularly need to stop and drink water. I am fit but jeez this hot yoga thing is a whole new ball game. Im concerned I may look rude if I am stopping every couple of minutes. I think I need to cut down on the at home workouts / walking and replace them with yoga.
I am loving doing something new and it’s been great for my anxiety. Im just a tad anxious I may come across as rude to the teacher because I’m stopping and starting. Im genuinely trying my best and try to go to the child’s pose when I’m feeling fatigued after drinking some water. 

Any tips for beginners? Im really keen to make this a long term hobby. 

Thank you in advance."
yoga,Am I expecting too much too soon?,"I gained 30 kgs over a span of two years, after having lead a fit and healthy life. The weight gain lead to a thyroid imbalance that suppressed my usually active metabolism.

From November last year, I have been following Ashtanga yoga practice almost everyday. I even completed my 200 hour YTT, taught theory (anatomy and philosophy) to other YTT students as a yoga teacher, and I am now considering going for the 300 hour YTT in May.

Though my practice has improved and I have lost weight, I am still nowhere close to getting into a headstand, or other advanced poses of the practice. I see batch after batch improving beyond my abilities in just those 25 days of their YTT, while my progress remains slow despite being regular with the practice. I cheer for others when they nail a difficult pose, but I can’t help wondering when someone will cheer for me :/

Am I expecting too much of myself?"

yoga,"I need help finding out the name of this ""moving"" posture","OK.

I've seen Kino MacGregor do it and I believe it's in one of the Ashtanga series, but I've searched and searched and can't find it. It goes like this:

Do sirsasana, fall back into chakrasana. Begin to walk the feet around to one side until they end up in face to you (so here you are in dolphin). You keep walking the feet around the other side and end back in chakrasana.

yoga,"Am I the only one who see inconsistencies in some of the ""benefits"" of yoga? What are these claims based on? (salabhasana/trikonasana)","Hello everyone. Right now I'm doing a 200 YTT. But sometimes when it comes to the subject of benefits of yoga I don't know what to think. 

I've always been a training &amp; physical conditioning enthusiast, in fact, I'm currently working on a functional training gym. So with the knowledge I have in the field it is hard to take it seriously when my teachers say things like : ""this pose gives a nice massage to x or y organs"". Another common thing I hear is ""trikonasana salabhasana help reduce abdominal fat and strenghtens those same muscles""

It is well known that no matter what, you can't decide or induce fat reduction in any specific body part.

It is also contradictory to say that you strenght or tone your abdominals when they are stretched when during Salabhasana for example you are mainly engaging your lower back /posterior muscles.

There are more examples of duvious claims but I've failed to find any information addressing this topic. I don't want to hate on yoga. In fact I think it is a great discipline but those claims dont stop bothering me.

 Is it like this in any school, do they all keep preaching the same benefits over and over without questioning the source?"
yoga,Thoughts and questions on cultural appropriation and religion in yoga.,"I am a white Canadian yoga teacher of 10 years, a studio owner, and a lead YTT trainer. Recently, I had a man tell me the other day that he loves yoga but hates the religious aspect to it. I had to stop myself from lecturing him about how divorcing yoga from Hinduism was both impossible and insanely disrespectful but, his position was not unique. In fact, I myself have once felt that way and so to many practitioners. Indeed, I am a practitioner of yoga but I do not consider myself Hindu or religious. I have and will continue to profit off this sacred practice letting people know that it can be ""whatever they want or need it to be"". Lately as I both get deeper into my studies in both yoga and anti-racism and colonialism I can't help but feel like I am a fraud and a thief, and what I practice and teach should not be sold as yoga as it is disrespecting the roots from which it comes. On the other hand, is it disrespectful to teach yoga asana and do our western yoga classes without a nod to its' south Asian roots? I certainly don't want to give up the practice (or my business or job!) I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on these issues and thank you."

The class is ashtanga based and it has been the only class I have tried where I learned a lot about each asana. I have never been to a class where each asana was described so well and the teacher really helped me progress and learn. The class has been bringing me a lot of joy through the year.

Besides the learning experience, and feeling safe and welcome, it was also the only place I could afford. Most yoga studios in my city go around double the price. Unfortunately, the gym is canceling the yoga classes and I'm feeling heartbroken.

I just wanted to share this and let it off my chest. I'm upset the gym is canceling the class. I'm upset that many other classes are not as well structured and explained. I'm upset because yoga studios are so expensive and I cannot afford them. 

Has anyone experienced something similar?

yoga,Opening Prayers for yoga,"I have always loved it when a class is started with formal prayer or invocation to start the class.   For me, it feels like it formally opens up the space for practice, and sets the intention.   I used to love these kind of traditions to start a studio class.   So much so that I brought them to my home practice.   I use the following, it is the formal Anusara Invocation, chanted in Sanskrit…

Om

Namah Shivaya Gurave
I offer myself to the Light, the Auspicious Lord,
who is the True Teacher within and without,

Saccidananda Murtaye
Who assumes the forms of Reality,
Consciousness, and Bliss,

Nisprapancaya Shantaya
Who is never absent and is full of peace,

Niralambaya Tejase
Independent in His existence,
He is the vital essence of illumination.

yoga,Class difficulty and progression,"Namaste!

I (32M) have been doing yoga twice a week at a studio for more than a year now. I don't have good flexibility (and due to some injuries outside of yoga, plus one at yoga, I got a bit set back in what flexibility I gained during this time but I'm working on regaining it) but I'm quite strong ( Chaturanga? No prob. Straight like an arrow servangasana? Easy peasy. Uttanasana without bending my legs? No can do.)

&amp;#x200B;

When I started practicing, classes were challenging, tiring and I used to sweat. Now I don't break a sweat. I feel like classes are not challenging enough because they're highly repetitive without striving towards advancing to a more difficult pose (teacher shows a pose and provides info on easier ones). I have switched classes a couple of times (I can only attend an Ashtanga Vinyasa class or a multilevel class due to my schedule), but after the first week I'm back at the not-sweating nor being tired stage. One day we did 108 sun salutations in one class and it was extremely liberating. I would like to feel like that more often during my practice.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I feel I have completely stagnated in my practice. My studio doesn't offer more advanced classes (it's either Hatha/Ashtanga or the multilevel class, and all the studios around me are like that) and I don't know what to do: do I ask my teacher for more challenging poses? Would I be disrespecting my teacher by asking for this? On the other hand, I'm not flexible, which translates into poor mobility, and I have the feeling that I need to improve on this before tackling harder poses safely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any input is welcome. Thank you for your time."

There are lots of yoga teachers in my town so I can also contact them but also they might charge or Are not organically part of the community I’m in. 

I guess my resistant around it is that 1. So many people are already doing yoga that I dont want it to look like I’m hopping on a trend or something &amp; 2. I dont want my boyfriend or others to think I’m doing it because my boyfriends a yoga teacher or something idk it sounds silly but it really feels like it’s holding me back.

yoga,Is it possible to do yoga if you have reduced mobility in an ankle do to an injury?,"Years ago while hiking in Iceland I fell from a ledge onto my toes and my foot doubled all the way back. This resulted in my anterior inferior tibiofibular band ripping of my bone. 


I received some exercises I needed to do during rehab, but at the time I didn't follow through with them. As a result the band has calcified and I can now no longer stretch my ankle forward past a 90 degree angle ( think of an L). I can still move it backwards just fine. 


Would this stop me from being able to do some of the poses and would it worth it to start doing Yoga in your opinion?"

I did a 40 min excercise for the first time (i did only 20-30 min so far) and it was sooo nice and ended with what they called a progressive relaxation which i usualy do on my own during savasana but with guidance it was even better. What a nice surprise!

But it made me think about how some people said that the app gets repetitive after you use it. Well i’d definitely recommend you play around with the settings because for example the duration of the excercise apparently plays a huge role in the variety you get.

I feel like after 3 months of using the app i still have so much more to discover and try with the different styles they offer and so far it’s much better for me than yt videos even though i sometimes miss chatty Adrienne :)"
yoga,What do you do when mental health issues disrupt yoga?,"Background.

I've experienced depression for as long as I can remember. I've had counselling and it has made a huge difference. Usually when I'm going through a rough period I treat myself kindly and do what I need to do to get through, no judgments just keep going and I'll feel better eventually.

Now.

This is the first down period I've had since I started yoga. I want to get on the mat, so I get on the mat. BUT...... I can't relax, my mind wanders (usually it doesn't), I get frustrated with almost every video I put on (rarely happens normally), I get annoyed when I can't do poses (never happened before now)

The last 2 days I've made excuses not to get on the mat because I don't want to feel worse when I get off - like I did 3 days ago. Honestly I'm on the verge of tears and feel like I've lost yoga for now. I want to curl into a ball and stay there. Very dramatic I know, I'll be fine again :)

Plan.

I'm going to try easy energising flows I've liked before. Keep it shorter. Focus on viewing myself with even more kindness than I usually do in yoga. I've even made a youtube playlist for Funk Days. 

I'm hoping this will allow me to breathe and move without feeling crap. I could do with a little endorphin boost.

What do you do?

I know I'm not the only one that has these experiences. I'd very much like to hear what you do?

yoga,Yoga inspiration - Footprints,"I wanted to share this story here. I initially heard it at the end of a restorative yoga session last week-end and really resonated with me. I particularly found it refreshing to learn how yoga can really help all of us unwind, ground us and often open our bodies even during times of uncertainty and adversity. 

“One night a man had a dream. He dreamt he was walking along the beach with the Lord. Across the sky flashed scenes from his life. For each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand: one belonging to him, and the other to the Lord. 
     

When the last scene of his life flashed before him, he looked back at the footprints in the sand. He noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times of his life.

This really bothered him, and he questioned the Lord about it. “LORD, you said that once I decided to follow you, you'd walk with me all the way. But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life,there is only one set of footprints. I don't understand why when I needed you most you would leave me.""

The Lord replied, “My son, my precious child, I love you and would never leave you. During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you.”"
yoga,"What, if anything, do you listen to while you practice? 😊","I have been an enthusiastic beginner with yoga for a few years now. 😊  I was first introduced to it as a method of treating/preventing running injuries but quickly found it to be pretty much essential for my mental health. 

I have experimented with a few different soundtracks to accompany my regular practice, from classical music to nature sounds, to silence to audiobooks etc. 

I just wondered what your preferences are with regards to listening to things while you practice, and if you have any recommendations/suggestions? 🙏"
yoga,Any tips to help with Halasana/Plough pose?,"Hi everyone! As the title suggests, I am looking to find help doing the Halasana pose which seems almost impossible to do with my body although I did manage to do it a couple of times.

yoga,I've been doing yoga regularly for years but am not improving my flexibility,"As the title says, I've done yoga for years now, and my flexibility still hasn't improved. I basically do it every morning for 10-20 minutes.

I've got some basic flexibility, like touching my toes when standing (slightly bent knees), but in general I'm just not very flexible. For example, my feet still don't touch the ground when doing downward dog, I can't touch my toes when sitting in staff position, and my hips don't bend that much, so it's often my lower back that's bending (unless I bend my knees). 

I want to gain flexibility and be able to do cool things, but I feel like I won't ever improve. What am I doing wrong, and anyone have any tips for me?"

yoga,Are you deciding between the Manduka Pro (6mm) and the Manduka Pro Travel (2.5mm)? I own both [AMA],"Hey there,   
when I  was researching which Yoga Mat to buy for my daily practice as well as for my travel needs I was often missing first person experiences / reviews. Since I didn't have access to a yoga store that would let me try different mats plus my studio at the time wasn't renting ay mats out due to covid I found it quite difficult to choose which mat to buy.

I now own the very thick and heavy Manduka Pro (6mm) in black since about 8 weeks and and absolutely loving it. I use it for my (nearly) daily home practice and lug it to my yoga studio of choice as well. My Travel Pro (2.5mm) midnight came in the mail three days ago and I'm loving it just as much. It's lightness (especially compared to my thick Pro) is beyond amazing and its even foldable. I'm planning on using it primarily for travel when I'm not able to pack my thick Pro.

So yeah, **long story short: Consider this a service post.** If you are currently debating on whether to buy either one of those mats and have any questions about them just ask away. I'm happy to review certain aspects, compare them to each other, weigh them, shoot some photos, ...basically whatever you want to know about them that helps you decide."

1. What should be my path forward (roadmap), should I increase the amount of times I do it per week, the difficulty level, the duration of the sessions, etc. If so at what pace and how? 
2. Also what should my attention be turned to when I practice, my breath, my body, the instructor's voice?

yoga,The prostitution of Yoga,Can someone please explain to me this phenomenon that is occurring everyday on yt? Why is there always a bunch of only fans girls flaunting their behinds and vageyeys and posting really bad and incorrect yoga?

yoga,Do you like Instructor to Participate? How do you feel about mirrors?,"I've been practicing yoga for about a year and have absolutely fallen in love with everything about it. I find I have strong feelings about mirrors and whether the instructor practices with me or not.

After reading a few books, watching some videos, and exploring a few studios, I see that practicing along with your students and using mirrors isn't necessarily common practice - but it's the way I've learned. And I really like it. 

I like having someone demonstrate the correct posture as I am doing it. It feels like we are on a journey together. And if I don't know the posture, I don't feel silly or blasted. I like having gentle cues and a mirror. Then I can intuitively feel into my body, but technically check myself. Without a mirror I am not empowered to check and feel my own form. 

Having an instructor simply walk around and play simon says (most not offering corrections with covid), feels very drill seargenty to me. Especially if I can physically tell that they don't value their yoga practice. I then go into performative, people-pleaser-mode to avoid public criticism and that just takes me out of my practice. I DO NOT like it. 

I ask because I hope to become a teacher someday. But knowing practicing this way (with a mirror and an instructor doing it WITH you) isn't standard makes me nervous. Can I be considered a serious yogi if I still practice alongside my students? Can I have mirrors up without it being about physical looks but physical form?  Certain books and teachers on youtube make me feel like I can't be taken seriously this way - but this style really resonates with me. 

As a side note, I have recovered from eating disorders and a personal trainer mother who was very body-image conscious. She was a hard-driving, narcissistic, high-achieving, ""push, push, push"" person - and I do not enjoy that energy in yoga or life, personally. Some do - and I support that - but I am more  spiritually drawn to yoga. It has rewired me from the inside out and bringing dramatic shifts into my life. 

I love it. I seek instructors who are in it for their hearts and not their butts. Though, I appreciate a tight butt, it's just not a priority to me at this point in my life. It's more a side effect of my strength. A school I am considering has no mirrors and it makes me feel so thwarted.

What are your thoughts about mirrors and learning/teaching the practice without them?

Do you like your instructor to practice with you or do you prefer they walk around and watch (maybe making gentle corrections)?"

Ive picked up yoga in january and I love it. I truly feel like it generally helps me balance my mental health. And I love how kind and thoughtful the yoga-community is! 

I currently do the ""breath"" journey by Yoga with adriene, which is rather calm and meditative. But still I find myself struggling with Stress (in the past 2-3 months) and especially my sleep for the past 1,5 weeks (pretty much since we changed time in germany/europe). I am currently in a very stressful Phase of my life that really triggers my imposter-syndrome and my existential fears regarding my future. For Some context: I am working on my final paper for my Uni degree (Deadline is creeping up on me), parallel there is a lot of paperwork I need to due for my health insurance and Student loans, while i am also looking for an entry Level Job within a difficult Job market. So overall I Do have a lot on my plate right now and its really keeping me up at night.

So in the morning I wake up extremely tired, its hard for me to Focus throughout the day, I can barely progress on my paper as I just cant seem to be able to comprehend what I am reading and writing and overall this stresses me out even more. I would love to improve my sleep, as I feel like my current lack of recovery and rest is a big contributing factor to my slowly crippling mental health.

When I stand forcibly straight, my butt is squeezed too tight, limiting power from my glutes, and I feel like the breath goes straight into my solar plexus area.

yoga,Advice on how to run and manage a dance/fitness studio?,"Hello! I dream of opening a dance studio. I'm a year away from fulfilling this dream hopefully, and I wanted to ask all of you for a little advice if it's not too much trouble. What are some important things to keep in mind when managing and running a studio and students? what type of system do you use for keeping track of attendance and how do you go about reminding students to pay? anything you might consider important that you'd like to add, be it little details as having a water &amp; tea stand, teaching, content, advertising, branding, to even time management or anything you deem valuable information I would be forever grateful for! 💖 

I will have my studio in an apartment, I'm also planning to teach 4h a day Mon-Sat, don't know if that's overload or if I should break up the times, I will not have any other teachers but myself. My public are women in their 17-40 (or older) and most students I have seen are busy moms or working women who are looking for a stress relief or hobby, so I will definitely be teaching at 20:00 &amp; 21:00 which is the time people usually get off work but don't know about the other 2 hours, if I should open in the morning or do 18:00 &amp; 19:00 too."

yoga,Two Questions: 1. Where Do We Feel Emotions? 2. Is Ego A Problem?,"We see with our eyes, hear with our ears, smell with our nose, taste with our tongue, and feel various sensations with the nerves in our skin and throughout the body. With what organ do we feel our emotions? In a recent post about channeling anger, one person said:

&gt;Anger is found in the ego. Once again the problem is ego.

I agree with the first part, sort of. Mental health professionals and others usually say emotions are in the brain. I don’t really buy that. I believe that what we call ego actually is like an organ and that is where emotions are felt. In Samkhya metaphysics, this is known as Ahamkara, literally, the I-maker, the doer or agent, sense of self or individuality, which is located not in the physical heart but in the metaphysical or psychic region that we associate with the heart, the center of our being.

If ego is a fundamental part of our psyche, how can ego be the problem? If not ego, then is anger the problem? Not necessarily. Sometimes feeling anger is appropriate. Probably most of us have said or done something out of anger that we later regret. Then, our response is the problem, not anger itself. At other times, feeling anger is not appropriate. In those cases, anger is the symptom, not of ego, but of egotism. There’s a difference.

What do you think?"
yoga,"I (36M) feel like I have weak shoulders doing many poses, but am an avid weightlifter. Will I adjust in time, or is there something I need to work on?","So basically, I'm above average in overall strength after consistently working out (weight training) for about 2 decades, but now I'm giving yoga a shot. I'm about a week in and the most difficult parts for me are balance (which I know will correct itself) and feeling like my shoulders are going to constantly collapse, even in ""resting poses"" like downward dog or even holding my arms above my head. Sorry, still new enough to this that I don't know the actually names for the poses lol.

I'm assuming that I've just focused my whole life on bulking up my vanity muscles and have left out some stabilizers that are causing this. But I could obviously be wrong?

Should I just continue with these beginner routines for now and hope my shoulders adapt, is there an adjustment I should be making, or is there something else I should be working on rather than just the beginner stuff?

For background, I danced for all my childhood so I'm very strict when it comes to my flexibility and durability, but for personal reasons I haven't danced in a while so my physical state is not the best right now. I have also gained some weight and I couldn't stop thinking about I can't do the postures properly because of it, and how I don't look like any of the people I see doing yoga online.

yoga,Who Knows A Yoga Pose For Channeling Anger?,"I used to be horrified by what the Russians are doing in Ukraine, but lately I'm really starting to feel anger. I'm also really inspired by the courage  of the Ukrainians. I don't want this just for myself. I want every yogi everywhere to take a minute every day to channel some positive energy their way. I know it's just thoughts and prayers, but it can't hurt, and maybe some people will want to do more."

yoga,Yoga after surgery - practices without hip movement?,"I recently had surgery near my tailbone, and am (for the short term) not supposed to move my hips very much. Especially not relative to each other.

Does anyone have suggestions for practices that can work around this? It seems like even the most gentle practices have child's pose, a forward fold, or something else that's not doable right now... let alone a lunge.

I've taken a week off yoga after the surgery after practicing almost every day for the first three months of the year. I really miss it! Thanks for any advice."

yoga,Hot 26 and Ashtanga in Downdog app,"Hello fellow yogis!
I am curious if anyone has tried the Hot 26 yoga option in the Down Dog app. If you have - what is the amount of minutes I should set for the practice? 90min?seems weird to have 26 poses and set a time limit less than that..
Also for any of you that have tried ashtanga - is the sequence the same but cut off earlier the earlier you set the timer for? Otherwise how could it be ashtanga?!
Thanks for your help!"
yoga,What stretches can I do to be able to sit in siddhasana and how long can I expect the process to take?,"Currently I can not do siddhasana, I cant even get my left leg in the correct position with the heel under the perineum.

If I stretch every day, how long will it take until I can sit in this posture correctly?"
yoga,Can you do yoga for physical purposes instead of spiritual and avoid enabling a kundalini?,"My question I guess would be is kundalini a necessity when it comes to yoga as I progress down the road?

P.S I’m still a beginner so please bear with me."
yoga,Happy Baby back issues,"I started doing yoga regularly over the summer with Yoga with Adrienne, and now I use the Down Dog app. For most of that time my Happy Baby was not great. I couldn't get my back flat, so I'd just be trying to balance on my spine, frequently losing balance and falling to either side. 

The last couple of times Happy Baby came up, being flat on my back was much easier and losing balance and falling to the side hasn't been an issue. I was happy because I assumed I was getting better at this pose, BUT I've been noticing some mild pain on my mid-back/spine that shows up a couple hours after I'm done, and lasts for a couple of days. It feels the worst when I arch my back or bend over. 

The first time I got this pain I wasn't sure where it came from, but now I'm pretty sure it's from Happy Baby. I already use a half-inch piece of foam under my mat when I practice, so I don't think more padding would help. Are there any modifications I could do that would help, or is it best for my to skip Happy Baby? Thanks!"
yoga,"Yoga class injured my back in January, still in pain, what can I do?","Hi everyone, so I went to a vinyasa yoga lass in January. I have done vinyasa before with an old teacher at this studio who has since left and enjoyed it. A new teacher is now at the studio and a friend invited me to join her class so I did.

It turned out to be a deep back stretching class, with lots of wheels and back flexing exercises. Now I am over-flexible, I have hyperextension in multiple joints including my lower back, because of this I'm very flexible naturally. But it also means that I am prone to joint injury. I told this teacher about this, but I feel that because I was ""naturally flexible"" she didn't really take my potential for injury seriously. Now my back has been in pain off and on for months.

Is there anything I can do to help this injury?"
yoga,"Yoga without the ""Spiritual"" aspect?","I have been doing yoga for a few months, some classes but mostly at home once I've interacted with a professional and made sure I am doing poses correctly.

I have really come to dislike what I would describe as the ""spiritual"" aspect of yoga - the ""energy"", ""flow"", mediation, the ""namaste"". I am not trying to discount other people's preferences, these things seem valuable to others but I personally find them distracting and I don't really believe in them.

I mostly just want to exercise and improve flexibility. So my question is basically...how do I avoid this stuff? Are there particular ""styles"" of yoga I could find, or is what I'm describing not yoga at all and I should look for something different? If it matters I'm male/late 20's."

yoga,yoga in a new town,"just wanted to share my off the wall, amazing experience here. i moved across the country by myself this past july for a fresh start on life after finishing my residency and finally starting my career. had practiced yoga and routinely utilized meditation podcasts for the past few years which really helped with my mental acuity and overall wellbeing. after moving, things had been so chaotic, i lost touch with all of it really. got wrapped up in trying to figure out my new life here with a new job and no friends and no support system nearby. 

finally realized how out of it i was feeling months later, and needed to take some time to reconnect with my mind and body. decided this spontaneously at work one day, on my lunch break just searched yoga studios near me and signed up for a class without much thought, for that evening. turns out, it was a yoga nidra class at a woman’s house. i moved from NY, where i was not very familiar with at home yoga studios. as i arrived at her house, i was a bit skeptical and waited until i saw someone else walk in first. 

without going into too much detail about my personal experience, it was my first time practicing yoga nidra which was exactly what i needed. i cannot describe in words how invigorating it was. the time passed so quickly, the class ended after an hour and a half, but it felt like 10 minutes to me. the instructor was so helpful and walked through how the class would proceed and made sure everyone felt comfortable. 

the instructor afterward introduced herself more to me and we got to know each other for quite some time, even after the other participants left. she talked me through a lot of issues i was struggling with after moving, meditation techniques she uses, and yoga techniques to try and work through some current pain. she ended up inviting me to stay for dinner after and i am happy to say we became friends by the end of the night. it was a totally unexpected night, but wanted to share how much just one yoga class can just bring you back where you need to be and for that i am so grateful."
yoga,A Brilliant Idea,"Today, it dawned on me that most studios offer a “new student” package on classes which generally involves an unlimited amount of classes for an X amount of days.

Brilliant, in my humble opinion."
yoga,What exercises can I do if I have advanced flexibility? Specifically how can I use Yoga to advance my strength/weight training routine?,"I have typed this question into google and the only things that comes up is: How to become more flexible.

Basically I want to know if there are exercises I can do that hit muscles I wouldn't think to train because of low flexibility. 

I started yoga for relaxation then I came to realize how much strength was needed to hold the poses. By the end of my first full session my legs were shaking like the first time I ever did barbell squats. I worked out muscles I didn't even know I had. Now that I have been doing yoga for sometime, I have become more flexible, and still getting more flexible. Now I am wondering what exercises I can go whether it be a weighted exercise at the gym or simply a body weight exercise at home that I can do now that I am more flexible and stronger. I had aches from yoga in places I didn't even know I could train, now these aches have subsided. **But is there workouts to do with increased flexibility. Is there perhaps an accredited program designed for people with more flexibility, or a youtube channel, website, book. Anything that can give me information on my question**

Thank you!"
yoga,Cold feet and cramping. Update!,"Thank you all so much for your guidance, help and suggestions. Based off the information I received I decided to try the 3 things that I could today. I took a magnesium and calcium supplement, ate a banana an hour-ish before my practice, then went for a 3 mile (planned on 2 but didn't feel like turning around at the mile mark) walk immediately prior to practicing. 

I had NO issues! None! Feet weren't cold, and there wasn't even the slightest hint at a cramp. I think the walk had the biggest impact here as supplements and nutrients take some time to build up in the body, but either way I'm sticking to what I did today. 

I can't thank you all enough. Seriously. It was so amazing to be able to just do my practice with no distractions, frustrations or pauses to warm and massage my feet. Thank you!"

Yoga hurts a lot. I feel like my knees dislocate and my tendons stretch awkwardly. 

I’ve been doing yoga for a bit (Around a month) and I haven’t seen a lot of improvements.

I’m doing it through the app Down Dog with fully guided beginner sessions. 

Best friend says it shouldn’t hurt and my body might need more time to accommodate to the stretch. They say I’m pushing myself too hard but I often feel like I’m not pushing hard enough. 

I try to be very attentive to poses and I really like researching them when I think about yoga. 

Should I avoid lower body stretches? They are the most problematic and make me vocalise pain.

yoga,Triceps pain when doing chaturanga,"I have been practicing half push up with my knees down for about two months, and it has been fine. Just two days ago I decided to try to do full chaturanga and push up back to plank. I was able to to 4 reps. It felt great but the next day my right triceps, medial head, or the part that close to the elbow started to feel pain, not the soreness of after workout. I tried to do push up again and my right triceps get tight and a bit painful. Is this because of poorly imbalance between the arms or the shoulders? Have anyone experienced this? I’m open to all advice."
yoga,What to do about tight hamstring in one leg?,"My right hamstring has been tight for the past four months. (I'm not sure why. I injured my right quad in December so maybe it was compensating, but it's been better for a while and other than that I can't think of any reason.) My hamstring feels a bit more relaxed after stretching, but it's significantly less flexible than the rest of my body. I've been pretty flexible since I was a child (tumbling, gymnastics), so I don't really know what to do about this issue.

I've tried rolling it out, but I've never done that before so I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly, and again, it feels more relaxed temporarily, but tightens up again.

Does anybody have any tips or experience with uneven flexibility/tight hamstrings? It makes me feel off when I'm doing yoga, like I can't do the full body stretches I want to because one hamstring is too tight."

Tried Jala neti for 20 days but saw no improvement. Is there any other asana which I can do which can help me to breathe through both the nostrils ?
yoga,"Scared of ""lightness""","Hi all,

I'm currently doing a pretty full on pranayama training course and it has made me reflect on the fact that all of the techniques in yoga that are designed to bring lightness to the body are extremely triggering for me. 

I've been practicing for years with shatkarmas, asana and pranayama along with sattvic diet as far as possible, and the common thread I'm noticing is an emphasis on raising the energy up - this is the goal of Hatha after all. I don't feel that I'm doing anything wrong as far as the sadhana is concerned, I just wonder what to do about this aversion to it. Of course I will talk to my teacher about this but I wonder if any of you have had similar experiences.

I just want to be a rock and cement myself into the ground this is so uncomfortable."

yoga,Deep relaxation question,"Hello everyone,

I wonder if someone could give me advice or share their experience. Due to anxiety I am pretty stressed all the time and I don't sleep well. That's why in the evening if I have a small argument with my relatives or I read about something upsetting it may happen that my nervous system becomes aroused. And it prevents me from falling asleep in a weird way - I may be super sleepy, and actually fall asleep many times but as soon as I fall asleep my body wakes me up. Meditation is helpful with getting into a state when I am falling asleep, but it actually does not help with this arousal feeling at all. So, let's say by counting breaths by the time I reach 10 I am already falling asleep but immediately woken up by my body. I don't know - maybe adrenalin in the blood or something like that.

I recently discovered some deep breathing/pranayamas that were more helpful with deep relaxation, but unfortunately last night they did not help either.

I have a guess that I may not do it long enough since I actually fall asleep pretty quickly as opposed to staying awake on purpose and continue meditating/breathing. However, it is pretty difficult even if I sit - I fall asleep regardless and woken up by my body anyway.

It does not happen often, but because I know I have no tools against it it makes things worse since I become anxious expecting something like that in the evening.

Does anyone have any advice on it? Pranayamas that I do: simple slow abdominal breathing and also some kind of 3 stage yoga breathing - when I slowly inhale from the bottom to the top of my lungs and exhale. Actually, I feel like pranayamas are potentially very effective sine I am able to calm my heart really well with them and get into a sleepy state. But still, not entirely enough to calm my body."

yoga,Practicing post Covid,"I had Covid in January of this year for three weeks. Two months before, I had bronchitis in November for almost the whole month. I started practicing again mid December. After “getting over” Covid in late January, I had chest pains almost every day until just recently. I went to the doctors, was prescribed steroids for a week and was basically just told to rest/wait it out. It’s been almost three months now since I tested positive and I’m so scared I’m never going to be able to practice like I used to.

yoga,"Kapotasasana, tears and joy of mastering a new pose","I'm a middle aged  woman and have taken up yoga over the past two years. While I have always been active, my flexibility has been poor. So, the first year of doing yoga, I saw a dramatic improvement in my flexibility. Along with it came tears. I had huge emotional letdowns every time my body got a bit more flexible. From being to barely able to hold a bridge pose, I was able to hold a wheel pose a year ago and can now do wheel comfortably. Same with the plow. The first time I did any of these poses, I  cried - a LOT. I've been very, very gentle with myself through this process. I've also felt certain poses ""call"" to me. Plow and wheel especially called to me and I could not rest until I was comfortable in these poses. 

Now I am drawn to full pigeon or kapotasana. While there were several videos and teachers who could help me with my previous poses, I do not see too much literature or youtube videos for kapotasana. Also, as I am starting to train myself in this pose, the emotions and tears are starting again. Just putting this message out here asking for good vibes and any tips on doing this pose. Thank you!"
yoga,Yoga for Heavy Labor,"Hi everyone,

   I'm trying to train for a special operations job, and I'm pretty tight/unbalanced. I have done a lot of long distance running, swimming, lifting, and heavy labor. I watched a David Goggins interview and realized I probably have a very similar problem I need to address.

   I started Bikram yoga, and it caused a lot of pain and tightness. So did the other 5 yogas I tried. I think it is too much for my low back and shoulder sockets in particular, and then my body fights it. Some stretches I feel I understand well and can relax into-others, they are just very bad for my body and that's why it fights back with spasms and shooting pains.

   Last-I remember I stretched my hamstrings very well one day and then my legs felt too loose, they had no spring when I needed to run. Same of yoga-I stretched my lats and my pullups the next day were very bad.

A) Where can I start with yoga to make my body better?

B) I see strong, flexible people often. Why is it that when I stretch, and have a good stretch like my lats, I feel so weak after and my pullups go down?

I really need to balance my body so I can be strong for this job and, ideally, very happy."
yoga,Did I pass out? Im confused...,"Hi,

So I have recently started yoga (2months) and something very strange just happened...

I did my regular routine and finished off with the upward facing dog pose. The blood went rushing through my body (very nice feeling) and i hold the pose until i couldn't hold it any longer. I went straight to the ground, and i believe i passed out (i might not). A few second later I had this feeling of euphoria rushing through my body.

yoga,How much do you push yourself in yoga workouts?,"Fairly new. Been going to a yoga studio for about 6 weeks. Learning a lot of new movements and increasing stability and mobility in moves and poses I've never done before. 

However, I noticed every movement we go through in class, I push to see how far I can get. Sometimes it's more a stretch, sometimes it's more of a strength (like going deeper in a lunge).

Prior to this I did weightlifting where it's fairly straightforward to try and add a bit more weight on the bar each time.

For yoga veterans out there, with moves that come easily to you do you keep pushing to the edge of your ability or do you take it easy sometimes?"
yoga,Extremely weak shoulders,"I have been doing yoga for a long time and my shoulders are insanely weak. I can barely do planks, and I can’t hold up my arms for very long in any warrior pose or chair pose. Even extended mountain can be really hard towards the end of class. 

Whenever I see shoulder strengthening poses it’s always like dolphin or lower planks. But I can’t even do those!!

yoga,first yoga class and I feel bad,"I have dabbled in yoga for a while, a drop in class here, a drop in class there. Two years ago I started an online course with a private teacher. I enjoyed it and my teacher was able to give me one on one and adapt some poses for my level.  I was living in a country that was much cheaper and was fully employed with a good wage.


I am back in my expensive home country and am only working part time. I wanted to start yoga again, partly because I have lost flexibility and muscle but gained weight over the past two years.


I found a beginner course for $95 for 12 classes.
I went to my first on Monday. I found it very difficult, like my fat stomach was in the way of doing any of the poses correctly. Even tho it is a small beginner class it seems as though the other students are already familiar with many of the poses. Instead of feeling better, it just highlighted how out of shape I am and how fat I have become.


I want to quit.


Does anyone have any advice, words or wisdom or motivation to make me not quit?
My next class is tonight."

yoga,Will I improve?,"Hey all! I just wanted to gauge some opinions from the more experienced yogis among you!

My day job is as an IT administrator. I sit down for hours on end and do little physical activity. I'm a 6ft 2 man in his mid-twenties and I'm exceedingly thin and lack any good muscle and strength. Anyway, I was recommended by a friend to look into yoga to build strength and ease my general anxiety. So I have. At least 4 to 5 times a week, I practice. First, I started out on my own, but I now have 1-1 tuition with a lovely local teacher for an hour a week. I love it. I am always excited to hit the mat and I want to continue for as long as I physically can.

I'm about a few months into this journey and I think I've improved in some areas, but something is bothering me still, and that is my body and how it reacts to certain poses. Downward dog, for example, everyone tells me this is a resting pose, but I feel like I'm doing a million pushups with it! Even with adjustments from my teacher, I still find this very hard on my upper body and arms and have often had to revert to child's pose to just rest. Pigeon pose? That one is just impossible, it seems. Easy seat? I need blocks under my legs or it hurts, even with blocks it isn't too comfortable. Boat pose? That makes my legs physically shake and tremble, as does waterfall. Forward Fold? sure, but I need to bend those knees too. 

So my question is this... am I just weak and will this all improve one day? Or am I just not built for yoga? I feel bad for my teacher as she is so patient and kind to me, but I feel like I'm the worst newbie as I just struggle with most poses that require any effort.

Thanks &lt;3"

yoga,Cultural education,"Hi there, Im someone who has only really taken up yoga properly in the past few months. I have a lot of chronic untreatable illnesses (mental and physical) and I’ve already noticed such a difference

I am a white person and I am very uncomfortable with the idea of participating in yoga without being fully educated on the cultural roots of it. Are there any people (specially those who are Indian) that could help me with this? Any books/YouTubers/content creators/etc that you would recommend? Thank you!

EDIT: I never said I HAD to learn the cultural history, but that I wish to. Please stop telling me I don’t need to! And, again, I don’t really want this advice from white people, thanks! &lt;3"
yoga,Sudarshan Kriya breathing technique and Hyperventilation,"Hi there !

I am very interested in all yoga breathing techniques (YBT). This has led me recently to an Art of Living class to learn how to practice Sudarshan Kriya (SK).

I read a bunch of scientific articles on the benefits of slow yoga breathing but I can't find any rigorous research articles on the Sudarshan Kriya technique and especially how its effects would differ from an hyperventilation episode.

During the practice, I found that the effects are pretty close to what is described after an hyperventilation episode : ""feeling faint, dizzy, or lightheaded"", ""a numb, tingly feeling in your hands or feet"", ""hand or foot muscle spasms"".

And since hyperventilation is deterrent for your health, especially in the long run, I wonder if a SK weekly practice would not be the same.

What's your standpoint on this matter ?

Are you aware of any specific research related to this concern ?"
yoga,People with physical jobs: balancing the need for strengthening with the need for rest. How?,"I work in ecological restoration. I’m a crew lead, and field work is 90% of my job. I love it! My shoulders… not so much. 

Sometimes, doing an active yoga session, strengthening supporting muscles and core and hips helps a lot, but often I just need to rest. I’m not always sure which is best for each day, each week. 

Is there anyone here with physics work? Restoration, landscaping, housekeeping, construction, agriculture, what have you. You’re moving through most of your day. 

What helps? What have you learned about your body, about strengthening and healing so you can go out there are do it again and again?

When do you know you need a break? Take some rest days?

I love my job, but I need to take care of my body."
yoga,Getting demotivated after hard yoga classes,"Hi! So I’ve been doing yoga for about two years, but I just started getting into yoga seriously since December last year. I find that when a class is too hard, or I find myself unable to do some of the poses I get demotivated easily and it’s harder for me to get back on my mat. I know it’s just my ego’s attachment to an idea of how yoga should look and feel, but does anyone have any advice on how to push through that demotivation while in a harder class?"
yoga,Bhastrika prayanayam,"How to do Bhastrika pranayama breathing. I called it yogic coffee

Sit or stand in a steady comfortable posture. Your back is straight, or as straight as is comfortable. Take a few deep breaths. Take care that your abdomen expands and contracts with your breathing. Start by exhaling through your nose. Contracting your abdomen as you do this. Followed by an inhale at the same rate as you had exhaled. Be conscious to coordinate your abdomen and your diaphragm while doing this technique. 

It gives you a quick energy boost. That's why a lot of people called it yogic coffee. Cheers

yoga,Attunement in yoga to heal trauma: any ideas?,"I have been thinking and reading about the concept of resonance and attunement: in therapy, in relationship, and related to trauma and trauma recovery. I started my yoga journey 6 months ago and have felt this incredible sense of feeling witnessed, seen, and understood while doing yoga and with my yoga community. I couldn't find the words to explain what I was feeling (other than being in a room full of empaths) until I started thinking about attunement in the context of a therapeutic relationship. I know Bessel Van der Kolk promotes yoga for trauma recovery, from the perspective of building a felt sense of safety in the body. Does anyone have any ideas, research/books or experience about this concept? For the yoga teachers out there, I am brand new to yoga and I view it through the lens of already having a background in the mental health field. Is this concept of attunement *taught* in yoga teacher trainings? Is it part of trauma informed yoga education?

I know there is research around incorporating yoga into group therapy, and the idea of yoga as trauma treatment has been researched a little bit. But I am curious how these concepts are mindfully incorporated into everyday yoga classes in the community.

Anyway, I am so grateful for this experience of yoga :)"

yoga,Is it too early to look for work?- Completing a YTT in early June,"If all goes well, I’ll be a 200 hour RYT in early June. I’m interested in teaching older populations, and I’d like to reach out to a local 55+ community to see if I would be able to hold a standing weekly morning class at their rec center. Ideally, this would take place over the summer starting in June. Since I have yet to graduate, is it too early for me to reach out to the events/activities contact to set set something up? I wouldn’t be teaching until after I’m certified, and I’m eager and excited to get started in early summer. What are your thoughts on me reaching out to the center prior to graduating? I’d of course disclose that my certificate is pending and I’ll have liability insurance planned before teaching."

yoga,Can’t get more flexible hips,"I’ve been doing yoga for roughly 4 months now and I can see a big increase in my flexibility except for my hips. I’ve always had extremely tight hips and I feel like there’s almost no progress even though I do a lot of hip stretches. Is it possible that I’m just built like that and there’s no way to get them to be more flexible? Or maybe there are some stretches that could help me? I’ve been doing malsana, pigeon pose, happy baby etc regularly and nothing changes…."
yoga,warm up/sun salutations are too hard,"So I've been practicing yoga for a year with an online teacher. For the first half of the year I had one ashtanga and one vinyasa class each week, and then just two ashtanga classes per week. 

I know ashtanga is supposed to be hard, but I don't actually have a problem with ashtanga itself. Just that the beginning sun salutations are very very hard for me, to the point that I've become very unmotivated to continue my classes even though I love yoga and don't want to stop my practice. After the wam up, the series itself is actually kinda easy and enjoyable for me. 

I know some of you may suggest to practice other types of yoga, but my teacher is very good and very experienced and is always up to date with current trends and has really helped me, and she only does ashtanga classes. I don't wanna change my teacher so I'm kinda stuck on ashtanga. 

Is there any way to continue doing ashtanga but make the sun salutations easier? Can I even skip them?"

yoga,"Getting Back on the Horse After ""Breaks""","How do you mentally handle it when your body is re-acclimating to practicing again and you can't do things you know you used to be able to do?

I've been practicing Bikram yoga for over 10 years now, and I've come to accept that there are going to be periods in my life where I can't make it to class, and I'm going to have to ""get back on the horse"" once I can go again. This is hard for me because when I AM going regularly, I'm a perfectionist. I'll attend posture clinics or do 30-day challenges. I'll be fine-tuning the tiniest movements in my knee, or checking before and after class with my teacher for advanced corrections I can practice during and around class.

However, then I'll have a period where I can't make it to class for external reasons. Even if I've only had a ""break"" for a week, I can tell once I'm back in class that I can't do as much as I could do before the break. It's not even necessarily flexibility — sometimes it's just cardiovascular health. It will take me 2-3 classes within the same week to get back to where I was physically. Whenever I'm ""getting back on the horse"" like this, I feel frustrated, and I even feel like my teachers are noticing the things I can't do.

It's also frustrating if I have a period of time where I can only go once a week, and I because of the low frequency I'll feel like I'm maintaining a baseline but never improving. It's irrational, but in these times I often feel like I'd rather not go at all than go and watch how bad I am.

Do you have any tips for managing these feelings, or different frameworks for thinking about practicing?"

yoga,"I used to love yoga, but my matt became slippery because it gets dirty so quickly, advice for new mat?","Hello everyone - if you asked me a couple years ago, I would have said that yoga has given me faith that I can become fitter. However, after about a month I started to notice my mat collecting lots of dust and dirt from simply being on the floor. The fact that this was happening meant I had to wash my mat in the washing machine at least once per week if I wanted to do daily yoga, which was just really annoying.

In the end I (sadly) lost the habit and stopped doing yoga. I really want to get back to it for mental health reasons, but only if I am a bit more prepared about how to take care of the mat. I still have my old one, but I don't want to use it as slipping while doing down-dog hurt my knees from the impact and made me upset. I have a GENKI mat that cost roughly 40 GBP. It's about 3 mm thick and has fabric on top. The fact that I can't find a website for it probably means it was probably some cheap brand on amazon? Maybe all my woes are just because of that.

I stored the mat rolled-up, but that meant that when the mat was placed on the floor, then that dirt would transfer to the top side while it was rolled up. When I put my hands on my mat, I'd slip and noticed my hands needed washing from dirt. I have a balcony so my floors can attract more dirt than perhaps some peoples homes, but I wouldn't expect that to ruin things.

I have some questions if that's okay:

1. How do you store your mat?
2. How do you clean your mat, and how often?
3. Would a more expensive mat require less cleaning? 
4. After doing some research, I'm willing to get a Liforme or a Manduka, but I can't quite tell which one to get. Does anyone have any suggestions?"

yoga,A beginner with poor core strength and tight hamstrings,"I am a beginner who has been practicing semi-regularly for the past year or so. What got me started was the lower back pain and the upper back tension for which yoga proved to be highly comforting. Through the process, I discovered that I had tight hamstrings and poor core stability/strength. Although I have seen a significant improvement in my hamstrings and I quite enjoy doing the stretches, I have yet to work on strengthening my core. My question is, should I focus on the hamstrings for now or focus on the core? Is there a sequence as to which one is more important in yoga?   


I look forward to any input"
yoga,Please help me understand,"I attended a yoga studio that had really high regards. I was a yoga newbie and I was only going once a week or every two weeks to try and fit it into my schedule. I tried all the classes and really resonated with yin. I was heavy into my trauma therapy work and taking the time to connect with me. After some time of getting comfortable in my body and mind, I attended more classes

One of yoga instructors claimed to be a witch, a healer, and really into herself. I knew of her as my friends at the time fiancé. She was different and I was open to learning from her. My former friend, I found out was a heroin addict and not active in his recovery. 

During different times I would see her or take her class, she would touch me while I was in poses, tell me that her fiancé loved me, touch my things (necklace on my body), and so into vivid detail about her and her fiancé love life. 

I didn’t think anything of it because I’m new to yoga and I’m not sure what is appropriate or not. The touching would be during warrior and she would put her hand on my hand and hold it there. Not really to adjust or support but just to touch. I noticed I was the only one she would do that too. I didn’t really have the concept of agency and speaking up and I just tried to ignore it. 

The final straw was that I was working on journaling and I was creating a mantra for the type of love I wanted in my life, I asked her for help. I wrote down all the things I was looking for in a partner and I shared it with her. I guess I created the mantra and she agreed it was a good one. It wasn’t until the former friend (her fiancé) brought it up to me but not directly, but in a teasing way. I did a little head tilt and was taken aback that happened. 

I immediately unfriended and Unassociated with that yoga studio and those people. They kept checking in with me to see where I was at and what was wrong. Finally after a year and with the help of my therapist I confronted her with a letter telling her she violated my space. She then offered to meet with me and it didn’t go well. She told me she was psychotic and that I was homophobic (because I didnt like her touching me??) She really twisted that moment of healing and validation for me to be mean and abusive. 

I guess I wanted to share
My story because it took me a really long time to do yoga again. I have a wonderful teacher who we have spent such amazing sessions on the mat together. She holds space for me better than I could have hoped. I am sad I didn’t get that experience with the other teacher and 
Hope that no one gets treated that way again."

yoga,A gift yoga gave me: body positivity,"I was at an event recently in the bathroom with other women who were discussing their bodies. These women were gorgeous, thin and young… and all they were doing were complaining about how they looked! The negative thoughts they expressed about their bodies made me sad because they were so harsh on themselves.

I am not better than them in any way. I’ve also had many negative thoughts about my own body throughout my life. I’ve never felt thin enough, muscular enough, struggled with acne and other issues that led me to the same negative self-talk these women were echoing. However, since starting yoga in 2021, I can reflect and realize that my negative feelings and doubts about my body have been minimized greatly.

In my experience, yoga and mediation have such a positive message about the body. When I get on the mat, I am grateful for the body I was given. I am proud of what my body can do through each pose. The rhetoric reminds me that I am strong and powerful, I don’t need self-doubt or negative feelings.

I truly didn’t realize yoga gave me this amazing gift of body positively until this experience. Of course, I still have negative feelings about the way I look and I have fitness goals I would like to achieve to look and feel better, but it’s been so great for my mental health to have those moments on the mat where I feel strong and proud of my body.

yoga,"What did I do wrong, &amp; how to manage it yoga-wise (hamstring)?","Not asking for medical advice, just for how people alter their practice (or not) if they get some pain.

About 5 months ago I resumed yoga (just at home) after many years' lapse. I have been to classes in the past (mainly Iyengar) with good teachers, and I also use Youtube and good books.

All has been going well, &amp; I've been slow &amp; careful, but this morning I noticed *after* practice that my right hamstring hurts.

It's not *very* painful, &amp; I didn't notice anything happening while practising. I suspect, though, that it was from the seated forward bend. Nonetheless, I did that with slightly bent knees so as not to force it (I'm late 50s &amp; not as flexible as I used to be -- though the last 5 months have brought great improvement). Is there any other modification to make this bend safer for people like me?

It feels like the kind of pain that will go away in time, not anything severe, and I only moved slowly.

I don't want to stop my daily practice, but I assume I should maybe avoid seated forward bend &amp; other poses that would tax the hamstrings? The left leg is just fine, it's only the right. 

Do you skip yoga for a few days after a mild hurt, or keep going at other, gentle asanas?

Note I'm not asking for medical advice, only interested to know whether people would just avoid the relevant actions. My instinct says, avoid the poses that may put pressure on that area, until it feels normal again. This happened a bit with my knees too in the first month, then they came good.

Most of the outcome of these 5 months has been in the opposite direction -- I can now do things I haven't been able to do for more than 10 years (crouch, twist, sit cross-legged), which is why I don't want to miss any yoga if I can help it!"
yoga,COVID precautions: bringing own bolster to class?,"Does anyone bring their own props to class (other than mat and towel)? I typically use the studio’s blocks and other equipment that I can sanitize before and after with wipes. But I’ve been getting into yin yoga and gentle yoga lately, and we use bolsters and blankets often. The material that these items are made of is not easily and quickly “cleanable” before and after use, so I’m considering bringing my own blanket and bolster to class. The blanket is easily packable and can be discreetly brought to class, but the bolster is quite massive to be lugging around. Any tips on carrying bags? Will it seem odd if I carried in my own bolster?"

yoga,we are beyond blessed to have this opportunity of Being Alive 💓🙏💓,"What if we all just wake up. What if we all just stop being patronized and abused by our own minds. 

What if we just stop seeking for ""something out there"" and realise that it's all here. It's never there. There is just a thought, a false impression. Happiness is always here. LIFE IS ALWAYS JUST HERE. 

There is sooo much to life that the word soo much is sooo little. 


There is soo much to this miracle and yet at the same time nothing actually exists except our total Being. 


We have this amazing opportunity to explore, discover and understand the nature of reality, may we not miss it. May we please not be interested in any superficial nonsense that this society wants us to believe and buy into and have the strength/willingness and courage to rise above all falsehood. May it be so...


May we all discover what we actually really truly totally want and follow our desire without being distracted with other beliefs. 



May God truly Bless you. Heyyyy, the world is not dying. The world is risinnn. It's awakening. Life is awakening through as and yet totally already awake at the same time. May you discover that everything and everyone in your life is a blessing on your spiritual path and may you not feel like a victim. May you feel free to express yourself without doubt or fear of otherness. 


May you be freeeeeeeee. Free from all doubt and delusion, as you have always been, before you adopted this skin.


There is so much I could share, but truly nothing can be said about this unspeakable miracle. 


Bless you, bless you, bless you... 🌞🌞🌞

Love you, love you, love you... 💗💗💗💗

PS: If you have read is so far, you are an absolute Miracle, thank you so much. Thank you for just Being. 😇🌟☺️🌞💗🙏

yoga,issues as a young man just getting started.,Every class I've tried is either full of older people or young women.  Either I'll be the only young person or the only man.  I want to be with people my own age and not have to constantly struggle to avert my eyes from beautiful women in skin tight clothing.  Mentally trying to never look is like trying to keep two magnets apart that are super close together.  Sometimes they snap together no matter how hard you try and I don't want to appear like I'm there to creep.
yoga,Soreness the day after after jogging and yoga gains,"My exercise regimen is basically jogging, Brazillian Jiu Jitsu, and yoga.  Yoga is the newest, jogging is the oldest (been jogging since middle school).  Yoga has been wonderful, but whenever I jog and am sore the next day, I have to wonder if I'm losing the flexibility gains from yoga.  Can you folks offer any insights?"
yoga,My yoga studio is closing and I'm heartbroken,"I started yoga back in September when I was in a really dark place, feeling so lonely and isolated that I was starting to feel suicidal, having PTSD symptoms and panic attacks daily. Over the last 6 months I have found this beautiful community at my local yoga studio 💜 It has become a safe space, and for the first time in years I've felt like I belong.  Signing up for that first class and making myself go has been the best thing I ever did for myself.

Today one of the instructors let us know that the owner is closing the studio. She said she's sorting out how to offer local classes elsewhere. But I feel so heartbroken, because this community really means something to me. The space means something to me. I hope our tight knit community can continue to flourish, but I'm going to miss the comfort and grounding routine of having this studio to go home to. I hate change."
yoga,Yoga for pregnant woman :),"Hi !

I've been doing yoga consistently-ish for the past two years. I stay at the 'beginner' level because it still makes me feel good - I don't need to be strong of super flexible. I appreciate the mindfulness of my practice and the spiritual aspect.

Anyway, starting next month I'll be trying to get pregnant. That's super exciting ! I have an anxiety disorder and so yoga helps me with my mental health a lot. I plan on using it for that purpose during the pregnancy, but I am also wondering how else I can use my practice to benefits me in this new journey. I don't know what else it could help me with and how I could modify my practice to keep being good and beneficial as my body modifies itself. I would like to learn about all of this. 

Can someone help me find resources about that topic ? :)"
yoga,Hip Tightness,"I've been practicing yoga since November 2020. I'm overweight with weak wrists, bad balance, and my practice is mostly restorative, on the floor. I've been working on my hips every day for a few months, but I've found that, even with the longest time setting in Down Dog, my hips don't fully release. Often, I'll go a lot longer, until I'm satisfied, but I can't usually get them to fully release. It remains painful no matter how long I'm in the pose, with or without pillows for support.

I suspect it's because the pose is bringing anxiety and trauma to the surface. My chest gets tight, and I feel so uncomfortable that it becomes intolerable and I have to stop.

I'm wondering if my not pushing through impedes my progress or if it's just a subtle improvement that I don't fully notice. I can't find anything online about tension not fully releasing in yoga poses."

yoga,Specific question about form when keeping hips square during pigeon pose,"I understand during pigeon pose you should keep your hips square. 

Consider something like Crescent Moon, where the glute of the leg behind you should be activated in order to brace and square your hips.

Should you similarly active the glute of the leg behind you during Pigeon in order to square your hips?

That affects the stretch, and it is possible to stay square without glute activation, so I would like to know which is right.

Thanks in advance."

yoga,Purvottanasana,"Hi

I have been doing purvottanasana for about two weeks now. When I do it I feel some intense activity in my hamstrings. I know it works the posterior chain but it supposedly is supposed to work the core as well. I have yet to feel anything happening with my abdominals. I'm wondering if this will happen later on. I only recently started feeling some glute activity, so maybe a similar intense feeling with my abdominals will come later on too?

Please feel free to share your experiences with/thoughts on purvottanasana. It would make me feel a lot better!

I like the combination of learning and practicing. I'll read about it, watch videos how to do the pose exactly and what it's for. And then I'll practice it. That will make it more fun.

But there is so much choice. Even for beginners. Because of some problems with short achilles heel, calfs and hamstrings, I would like to begin with some poses those areas would benefit from. Could someone maybe give me some suggestions which poses I should pick to begin with?
I also would like to learn how to relax. I hold on to a lot of stress. So any particular yoga pose for that is welcome as well ☺️"

yoga,Can I ask your feedback on my accountability group app mockup?,"Hi guys, I've got an idea about accountability group app and I'd like to ask your feedback on it.

I found accountability group is most effective way to keep one motivated, but no services are suited for it. The biggest problems are:

* You have to manually report or post your progress, which is annoying and skip-prone. 
* You are visible only when you post. No one knows and cares when you miss a day or two. 

So I just drew mock-ups of an app that solves the problems.

**How it works?**

* You can create an accountability group and set daily programs. For example, I can create a group for my family or friends or YouTube creators can create one for their subscribers.
* Daily programs can be either YouTube video(s) or plain text.
* When a member joins a group, s/he sets a goal(how many days to achieve) and reminder(when to work out during a day).
* Daily tasks are presented to group members in the main screen of the app. 
* YouTube videos are opened and played in YouTube app(or a browser) when clicked, then it is marked as done automatically. No manual logging is needed.
* For plain text tasks you can simply tick the check mark. 
* You are visible even when you miss a few days. Group leaders or members can encourage you to do it.

**Feedback points:**

* Do you want to use this app if it's available now? 
* If yes, please describe the best group you would join, leader of the group, daily programs etc.
* If yes, do you want to create a group for yourself? How do you want to run the group? Who would you invite and what programs do you want to set?
* Is there anything you don't understand in the mockup?"

yoga,A Yogi Dancing With Krishna: Still Attached to What Comes And Goes (Who Is He?),"Hello,

This is a story about a famous yogi whom I am trying to identify. He had/has a higher dimensional communion with Lord Krishna, with whom he would dance. People would adorate him for this feature, and he himself felt quite accomplished because of it as well. Later on, however, he met another yogi, whom told him something along the lines of: ""If you are thus reactive to this spiritual experience, you are still attached to what may come and may go.""

For a writing project, I would greatly appreciate it if I could get a more accurate account of this matter, as I am now presently merely reciting a story I once heard from memory. I know the yogi was famous, and I would like to know his name; also, if possible, the name of the yogi that corrected his attachment towards the ephemeral in spiritual form. If I could get a literal account of this exchange, perhaps in the words of the yogi in question himself, then I would be deeply grateful. It might have been a yogi named *Yogananda*, but I am truly uncertain. Thank you so much for anything you can do for me.

Your humble brother,

*Illaeyiim*"
