pilates,Thoughts on BB IQ reformer?,"Does anybody have experience with the Balanced Body IQ reformer? I’m able to get one off of FB marketplace for $1600 including the box and jump board… good deal? I am a Pilates instructor and teach on Allegro 1/Allegro 2, but have not used the IQ. Any insight how how they compare and pros/cons? Thanks in advance!"

pilates,Mini pro or reformer,"Hi there!

I am new to lagree and have been attending studio classes the past few months. Therefore, I am familiar with the Megaformer. I have not yet been exposed to a reformer in person.

I would like to make a purchase of either the mini pro (when it comes out~ $2-5k) or a reformer (used 200-300$). The price difference is a large gap.

I do love the Lagree method and want to see if I could buy a reformer but perform Lagree moves. I understand that the reformer is meant for Pilates but the price of the mini pro is just too steep for me.

Is this possible?

Thank you in advance!"

pilates,Looking to Purchase Reformer - Seeking Advice/Help,"Hey all - I'm looking to purchase a reformer for my wife (5'0) though I plan on using it as well (5'11, 160 lbs). Anyway, I've zeroed in on Merrithew's SPX Max Reformer Vertical Stand Bundle (comes with  Padded Platform Extender and Box) which costs around $3500 USD as well as the Allegro V1 (don't feel like waiting for V2 as they don't even seem to have a lead time) which is slightly cheaper. 

I'm leaning towards the SPX Max but wanted to get opinions from the group on how the two compare in terms of quality and ease of use? Also how limiting (if at all) is the narrowness of something like the SPX Max? Are there any other reformers I should be looking at in this price range?"
pilates,Who is your favourite pilates instructor on YouTube?,"I have pilates class 2x per week, but I want to do more at home. The only channel I know is blogilates, as I did some of her videos for a period of 2 months about 4 years ago.

pilates,"Two studios, how to choose?","I'm hoping fellow Pilates lovers can offer guidance. I recently moved and I'm trying to decide between two studios -- one is a 10-15 minute walk away and the instructors are trained in Stott Pilates, the other is a Classic studio that's a 10 minute drive/14 minute bus ride away (or an hour walk that's mostly uphill). I am trying to be more reliant on walking, so the closer one is tempting, but the Classic sequence and progression is so enjoyable and rewarding to me.

I have also been disappointed by instructors who advertised being trained in ""contemporary"" ""Pilates."" For instance, in one class, the instructor had us roll a ball against the wall with our backs (what the heck?). To be fair, she only said in the class description that she incorporated ""Pilates movement"" in her workouts, and then told us after we did the Hundred, that she didn't follow the mat sequence because it was ""boring."" That was the last time I worked out there. I'd like to avoid that kind of experience.

I'm leaning toward the one I can walk to, but if I did the Classic mat sequence at home, would that clash with doing Stott style at a studio? Maybe I can take the bus to the Classic studio and just walk home (at least it's downhill on the way back lol). I can't seem to find an answer online that isn't selling me something (not from these two studios, just in general), so I'm hoping actual practitioners can explain if the difference is so great to be noticeable. Would love to know what others think!"

pilates,Tight hamstrings.,"Since forever, my hamstrings have always been tight. So much so I was in a regular yoga class with a strict teacher who would routinely tell me to stretch more in certain poses until she realized I just was so tight.

pilates,Returning to Pilates after Covid,"Well, I went on vacation to Mexico almost 2 weeks ago and caught Covid.  First time.  I am currently feeling a lot better - Day 8 since symptoms - and currently completing a round of anti-viral medication.  Prior to being infected, I was attending Pilates reformer classes 4-6 times per week.  I am just wondering if anyone has any experience with returning to regular Pilates workouts after Covid infection.  I was getting really strong and now I am really anxious that I won't be able to do the same things I was doing before I got sick.  Maybe I am just stressing out.  I am thinking I am going to wait at least one more week before I go back.  Obviously, I will have to test negative before even thinking about going back.  I haven't tested again, but plan to tomorrow."

pilates,questions from a beginner,"hello, i (16f) started pilates a few weeks ago and i'm really enjoying it! i have noticed that my flexibility and posture have improved a lot, along with positive mental effects, which is really encouraging :)

here are my questions:

* am i supposed to engage my core in every exercise/pose?
   * how can i do that? i roughly know how to engage my core but i am unable to keep it engaged while focusing on the moves/breathing so i don't think my core has felt the effects after each session
* please correct me if i'm wrong, but do i exhale as i perform the move, and inhale as i relax? 
   * i find it easy to focus on my breathing when i think of it this way, but i'm not sure if it's the correct breathing rhythm \^\^

i know that pilates isn't about aesthetics, so pardon me if this is redundant:

* i would like the muscles i developed (mainly through pilates) to show on my body, but i have quite a high body fat percentage (&gt;25%) so i look flabby and shapeless (especially on my upper body), or essentially skinny-fat
   * i am at a healthy weight/bmi for my height (\~5ft, 100lbs / \~150cm, 45kg), and i'm not focused on weight loss, just getting rid of the excess fat on my whole body while maintaining muscles 
   * i do pilates only as my main form exercise x5 a week, along with jump rope (200-500 jumps depending on my energy levels) or 1-2 mile walk, and very rarely i go swimming
      * i did try committing to a hiit workout program but i didn't enjoy it at all, and it was the same with strength training + i'm not allowed by my parents to do it, so these forms of exercise are not sustainable for me 
   * i try to focus more on eating protein in my diet, followed by veggies and fruits; i eat around maintenance (i think for me it is \~1600 cals? please correct me) or at a slight deficit
      * i hope to not be too focused on calories or being too restrictive about fried/sugary foods, but i'm a bit apprehensive about fitting these foods in my diet as i'm afraid it will affect my progress or results (eg. regaining the fat back)

thank you in advanced! sorry for the long post \^\^"
pilates,Muscle soreness,"I do reformer pilates 3-5 times per week. I have noticed that muscle soreness has persisted, despite these regular sessions. I haven't radically modified volume or spring tension. This soreness seems to be more frequent than what I've experienced in weightlifting programs, which I did seriously but no longer do. Are the smaller muscles that we engage with pilates more prone to soreness? Other ideas?"
pilates,Muscle Soreness,I've been doing reformer pilates pretty seriously for a couple years now and did mat pilates for a year before that. I average 3-5 sessions per week and I have been working at the same spring tensions for a while now. My question is about muscle soreness. I have noticed that I'm more prone to muscle soreness in pilates than with previous serious weight training programs. I thought this would subside but it hasn't. Does anyone else have this issue?
pilates,will hanging the box cause any damage?,I have a very small studio space and would like to optimize organization.  The arc hangs on the wall (got a foam one) and there is space to hang the box beneath it.  Would this damage the box at all or warp it due to hanging by it's own weight?

pilates,Slower pilates classes,"Hi, could anyone suggest slower pilates classes on youtube? For some reason I can’t keep up the pace on most classes and therefore either do the movement wrong or focus on getting it right and get barely any reps in. Usually beginner-level classes are slower, but those don’t serve enough resistance as I’ve done lifting before. 

I absolutely love the ”gentle pilates”-classes from Move with Nicole, but unfortunately she only has few of them, and I need more variation in my workouts in order to keep my motivation going. Anything similar to those I would love to try!"
pilates,Abs!,"I understand that by doing Pilates, it doesn’t mean you will have a completely toned body but I have been struggling with the fat that is right over my abdominal wall. Much of my body has toned nicely thanks in large part to Pilates. However, I can’t seem to get rid of the fat on my abs. For example, in plank there is excess fat that just hangs right over my abs while my obliques are toned. 

Curious to see if anything has helped you personally or if you helped a client with this problem. I am not sure if this is a cardio thing but overall my diet is healthier and I wouldn’t want to lose much more weight I just would love to feel more comfortable with this section of my body, especially in certain poses. 

I am shorter, 5’3 and have had two children but I don’t think this is excess skin but fat?"

pilates,Is it better to do a full workout all at once or broken up throughout the day?,"I have recently started doing some Pilates exercises to help with neck pain.

Currently I do 5 minutes per day since I'm a beginner. I slowly want to increase the length of my workouts. My question is, is it better to do 1 longer workout or several shorter ones throughout the day?

I want to work out 5 minutes in the morning and 5 minutes in the evening, and in the future when I'm ready 10 minutes morning and evenings, and more if I feel like it

pilates,Balanced Body Mat Certification,Hey guys! I am getting my mat 1-3 certification through Balanced Body. Do I also need to be taking exam via National Pilates Certification Program afterwards? Or is it optional?
pilates,The “Pilates body” myth,"Too much Pilates marketing is fixated on the “Pilates body” and leads people to believe that doing Pilates will magically make them thin, toned, long and lean.  But it’s just not realistic. We’ve all our genetics and our lifestyle.  Many people will not get every muscle defined no matter how much Pilates they do. 

Every person can benefit from Pilates and become stronger and more functional in their body, no matter what they look like. I have many clients who have bigger bodies and are incredibly strong and healthy.  I have clients who are thin and toned but have many issues and struggles with functional mobility.   Your body shape is not an indicator of your health or fitness. 

Many of the people we see who are fitting the idea of the Pilates body are getting that way through over exercising and under eating. I just saw on the forma Pilates sub that she posted what she eats every day and it was disturbing!  I personally want people to understand that Pilates will give you your best body, not make you look like the lady in the video your following.  

Joseph Pilates created his system to improve quality of life. Our bodies need movement in all its variety and Pilates gives that. What you look like is not the point. What you feel like and how you live in your body is."
pilates,Tips from those with an at-home Pilates studio,"Hi, 

I'm currently looking for a rental apartment in Ontario to open and at-home Pilates studio. I'll be purchasing a reformer with a tower and offering 1-on-1 private classes. 

I was hoping for some tips from those who've traveled this path. Do you have an at-home Pilates studio? Are there any lessons that you learned that might stick out for you that you might want to share?

If you have any advice in the context of Ontario, Canada, that would be great, or general advice as well!

Some of the main areas when opening a business are:

* incorporating the business v. sole proprietorship (which is best?)
* best practices around operating an at-home studio from insurance to relations with the landlord to client boundaries
* opening a business banking account (any bank might be best with the most perks?)
* marketing with social media, a website, newsletters, business cards and at locations

Thanks so much for reading!"

pilates,How to handle burnout as an instructor.,"Hey all, I’ve been teaching for the past 5-6 years, mainly group reformer and 1-1 sessions.

However, as of late I’ve been stretched really thin. I’ve been doing lots of extra cover for other instructors and not doing really anything for myself outside of work.

It doesn't matter if I have the handles looped over the shoulder pads suspending the ropes or laying on the side. The rope goes slack and rolls into the track every time I go up. Here is a top view.

pilates,“Toning”,"Pilates marketing makes a lot of promises but I’m sorry to say that like most marketing it’s quite deceptive.  

“Toning” is such a weird claim.  What is that exactly?  It appears to be code for “thin with defined muscles”.   But what about strength?  Pilates will build strength!  It’s a body conditioning method that develops a well balanced and functional body.  

However, what a body looks like is really down to genetics.  Some people can do Pilates regularly and have a healthy diet and include cardio exercise and yet not looked “toned” or have that so called “Pilates body”.  But they’re strong and healthy and functional.  Because that is something Pilates will do for everyone.  

Some people can get a lot of muscle definition.  Some can’t.  Personally I can develop definition in my upper body but not so much in my legs.  Even as a gymnast and professional dancer who did lots of Pilates I never had “dancer” legs because… genetics.  

We can not really control how our bodies look. All those fitness influencers we see look like they do because of genetics.  Or sometimes it’s a combo of over exercising and under eating which is very very unhealthy.  Many women in Hollywood live like that to keep up that look.  And people think looking thin and toned equals healthy but it’s just not true.  Why do you think so many dancers have eating disorders?  Because even with 20 hours of dancing a week not many will have that “dancer” body.  


I wish more people would value being strong, healthy and functional.  Pilates can absolutely do this for everyone.  You can be very strong and healthy and not look “toned”.  And you can look “toned” and be very unhealthy.   Don’t buy into the marketing BS.  Look for what it can do for your quality of life.  Living well and aging well are worth so much more than some mythical “look”."

pilates,"Club Pilates Tracher Training, little Pilates experience.","I recently started doing Pilates ( 2 months) and I love it. So much so, that I started reading about Pilates anatomy, learned about the history and story of Joseph Pilates, and really focusing on my breath and the mind muscle connection during my sessions. Becoming an instructor is something I know I want to do eventually, but always thought I’d need more experience first. 

So far I’ve only trained at my Club Pilates and had 1 one-on-one session with a classical Pilates instructor. 


I signed up to get info on club Pilates teacher training/curriculum and currently there’s a $700 off promotion and two months of free unlimited membership for training. It’s a very attractive deal and only available for 2 more weeks. 

My question: can I begin training to be an instructor with little Pilates experience? If it’s worth anything, I’m very coordinated with experience in weight training, studio pole fitness, some ballet, and yoga. I currently take mostly reformer 1.5 and sometimes 2 classes. 

I get there are different styles of Pilates. I personally enjoy Pilates for the fluidity, subtle movements, slow control movements, muscle connection, and connecting with the breath. 
 

I’d like some thoughts, considerations, and opinions from those with more experience than me before I make any decisions going forward with Club Pilates. 

Or is it better to wait until I have a better foundation, and train with a different method, possibly one that’s likely more widely accepted ?"
pilates,Pilates + Weight lifting split for a newbie,"I want to start incorporating pilates into my workout routine but don’t really know where to begin. I enjoy lower body heavy lifting but I struggle making mind-muscle connections when it comes to my upper body which is causing me back pain and (I think) a lack of results. I want a more toned upper body and I’ve been seeing splits of lower body lifting and pilates focused workouts, but I don’t want to over/under-do it. I also would like to improve my overall stability and posture.

I would keep training my legs/glutes with weights 3x a week and adding 2 at-home pilates workouts with some mild cardio here and there. 

Will that be enough to start seeing results? And if its mat pilates should I be doing it more often then 2x a week? Can I do both lifting and pilates on the same day?"
pilates,Are there types of pilates classes that don’t constantly involve smashing the low back into the floor but rather have more of a focus more on neutral spine?

pilates,How important is it to add additional exercise with Pilates?,I seen on the fitness page people were discussing Pilates vs weight lifting and a lot of people said Pilates wasn’t enough and weight lifting should be added as they compliment each other. So I thought I would ask people’s thoughts on here as I’ve noticed a lot of people have opinions on Pilates that may have never actually tried it... I was doing a high intensity workout before I switched to online mat Pilates 5-6 days a week and I used to feel extremely tired after a workout but now I no longer feel tired after doing Pilates and feel extremely energized so my body seems to respond to lower impact better. I have four young kids and can’t afford reformer classes and also don’t have someone to watch my children so I could go but should I be adding something else?

pilates,How to elegantly transition from supine to prone?,"I've been doing Pilates on and off since the pandemic began, mostly mat.

I use Pilates Anytime which is incredible. 

My single pet peeve with classical mat Pilates as taught on Pilates Anytime is that transitions between body planes (supine, prone, side) are not encouraged or taught.

The instructors always say ""ok, now turn on to your back"" or ""turn onto your side"". I really don't like how clunky these transitions feel. I always get a little annoyed with the breakup of flow as we switch from abdominal series to swan and the prone series.

In traditional yoga (which I practiced for many years), there are elegant and challenging ways to transition from stomach to back and vice versa. For example, the cross-legged lift with a jump back.

Does Pilates have any elegant transitions? Are there any teachers on Pilates Anytime who particularly focus on these transitions?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning for my spouse who became a part-time instructor a few months ago at a local studio. She does private lessons primarily with around 10 steady clients. I just wanted to see how much it might take for me to help her open her studio (her dream) and see how much it might need to break even. We live in a large city with high living costs.

&amp;#x200B;

I know instructor quality should be the most important, but I can't evaluate skill and perception on an objective scale when it is a subjective thing.

pilates,Dodgy spine 🤣,"Hello, I work out regularly with weights and kettle bells. 
I do this at home because it suits my lifestyle better. 
I recently decided I wanted to try some beginner Pilates as I’d like to increase my core strength. 
I don’t know why but forever I’ve struggled to do a full sit up because it feels like the bottom of my spine is digging into the ground. 
When I was doing this particular exercise I was very careful that my spine was flat to the ground and not arched. You had to put your legs to a table to sort of position and then move/ roll slightly side to side in a crunch position. 
The whole time I could feel like the bones at the bottom of my back digging and crunching into the ground as I went side to sideS.

pilates,Aeropilates number of cords,"Aeropilates has so many models but it seems like number of cords is the biggest difference. Is there some guideline on how many cords I should get? Is it based on strength or is it more about fine tuning? 

I've read some comments here that you actually use less tension as you get more advanced so would I be ok with the 3 cord even though I've lifted weights in the past? 

Also, for people who have used cords vs springs how different is it?"
pilates,YouTube vs app,"Is there a benefit to subscribing to an app over YouTube videos? So many choices out there it’s overwhelming. Has anyone started with YouTube like Move with Nicole and moved on to a pilates service like the pilates class, align app or core club pilates by Amanda?"

pilates,What is the order of spring combination tensions on Balanced Body reformers?,"I understand the tension increases from blue to red to green but what is the order of progression in combinations? Is there a chart somewhere? 

Like is blue+red more or less than a green? Is a green more or less than the two reds? 

When I have a blue+red or blue+red+red I'm always confused what the next increment up would be. Add a green and remove a blue or a red or a blue+red?"
pilates,Red Flags with Clients - Is this Common?,"My Pilates business is so new (as in &lt;2 weeks) that I don’t have a LinkedIn Account. I’ve advertised Pilates instruction on instagram and kijiji and I’ve been building my website. 

So far 2 potential clients have reached out to me via the kijiji add. There were many red flags with the 1st client. I’m not sure how useful sharing my experience with this individual is, but maybe it’ll give a heads up to others starting up a small business and booking appointments.

The client called me on Monday at 9pm for the free intro session. They say never to pick up a business call after hours or your CNS will become habituated to turning on your fight/flight mode at all times of day. I was excited to receive this first call however, so I picked up. 

I wanted to book a 15-minute intro session but the client asked if we could talk now briefly. He seemed depressed. I thought it could do no harm to make an exception for a potential first client. We went through a postural analysis, his health, his goals. And then he spoke for some time about his uncertainties working out and his bad experiences with previous trainers who only seemed interested in money. He apologized for taking an hour of my time instead of 15 minutes. He said that he didn’t understand how to make an e-transfer and wanted to speak later for a tutorial. I told him it would be no problem and we could do a Zoom screen share for 5-10 minutes later. 

The next morning, on Tuesday, I sent him an email with a thank you letter for reaching out, his proposed schedule, and a infographic of his next steps. 

He then texted me at 9pm again that night asking if I could chat. I texted him back that I’m unable to meet virtually now, as I’m with my family, but he could call me during business hours. He then called me and I was shocked and ignored it. He called again, and I picked up feeling peeved and curious. 

The client apologized and asked if we could just have a zoom call to go over how to make an e-transfer now. He said that he could send the money over to me for the online Pilates classes tonight. 

I agreed, feeling peeved but thinking that it would be a start to my business. My first income with my business. 

It was on me to start with a question about how his day was going instead of diving into the invoice. He seemed depressed and self-critical and I asked him if he’d like to do a 5 minute settling meditation which he declined. 

He then offered to pay me $125 per online Pilates class - roughly double my advertised price. 

He asked me if I would be willing to meet in person if he wanted to give me a larger sum of money, like $5000. I told him it wouldn’t be necessary to pay for that many classes in advance. TD Bank has a $3000 e-transfer cap per week so he’d be covered paying monthly at $1500. 

He seemed frustrated and then asked me if I could be assertive a few times. I now began to suspect that he wanted something outside of Pilates instruction. I began to get the vibe that he had a fetish for submission. He wanted me to say, ""You have no choice. You have to do this."" I nervously began to wonder how to end the Zoom meeting and let him know that I would not be able to work with him. I told him it was already 10:20pm and tried to end the conversation.

The client continued to mention the e-transfer and paying me. He said he wanted to help me out. That his money could be used to buy a Reformer. 

Then he said he was afraid to tell me what he needed because he was nervous that I’d stop working with him. This made me feel very uncomfortable. I felt angry at this point and told him he needed to tell me his needs so I know if it’s a good fit working together. I was already certain at this point that I didn’t want to work with him but I felt curious to have my suspicions validated. 

He said he’d let me know in the morning after sleeping on it. 

After our call, I immediately drew up an invoice for our call of $50 which he agreed to pay during the call. 

I called my boyfriend who said he already thought the client was very fishy from the Monday conversation, since he called after 9pm and spoke for so long. I felt a bit stupid for being patient with the client and caring about his description of his rough day/life. I suspected that he was depressed, anxious and possible schizophrenic. 

Today, I’ll be emailing the client that I don’t believe his needs align with the Pilates services that I’m offering. I doubt he’ll pay the invoice for the 60 minute talk yesterday. 

A part of me is wondering why my first client with Pilates Colours just had to leave me feeling so icky and used. 

A small business is a hard thing to own and operate. Things hit you that you’d never expect. But am I going to give up? Hell no! But I wonder if others have experienced similar things with their clients. My very first client coming in this form makes me feel that perhaps it’s a common thing."
pilates,"Club Pilates Unlimited, Passport and Freeze policy","Does CP's Unlimited membership work at any location? I've read some commenters say Unlimited works anywhere (but not the 4-8 pass). 

However our front desk person said Unlimited only works at their two locations and you need Passport. But she didn't really seem very sure or how Passport actually works. The [website](https://www.clubpilates.com/passport) is very vague with an 'upgrade now' button that goes nowhere. Does the policy change based on your home location?

Does anyone have Unlimited and use it in different areas and did you need Passport to book classes? 

Also, how granular is it if we freeze the membership? If we do a 2 week trip would we be able to freeze that length or would it have to be for the whole month? Is there a freeze fee?"

pilates,Pilates took an inch off my waist!,"Before kids I had a pretty defined waist but after my first child was born my waist looked “wider” (I know this sounds weird). I started exercising at 6 weeks postpartum but even after a year, the exercise I was doing didn’t help with making it more defined. I had assumed my body had expanded during pregnancy so it was my new normal. Since then I’ve had two more pregnancies with my last one being twins. I was originally doing Tracy Anderson Method which was the only workout I’ve ever done but I found it no longer felt good for my body so I switched in February to online mat Pilates classes 5-6 days a week, 30, 45, &amp; 60 minute classes. This morning I decided to measure and I haven’t lost any weight but I lost an inch off my waist! I compared photos from before I started Pilates to now and I can really notice a difference in my definition and I couldn’t be happier because I thought it wasn’t possible. So happy I made the switch to Pilates and wanted to share with fellow Pilates lovers."

pilates,Should reformer leg work be harder?,"I'm a 45 years old male, 6'3"", in decent shape, and most of pilates is very pleasantly challenging for me... with one exception. 

Traditional pilates leg work on a reformer. It's too easy 

I'm referring to the series where you basicallly do squats laying down on the carriage with toes in v-formation, heels at the corner, toes on the bars, etc.

None of it is hard for me at all.

I put all the springs on, but it still feels like I'm barely working. And so, I focus on form instead, and it ends up being more of a meditative excerise for me (which is very pleasant!)

And maybe that's ok? Maybe it shouldn't be a rigorous burn? Or maybe these machines are slightly better optimized for shorter people and/or women? 

Or, perhaps there is some modification I could be doing? I asked my instructor and she said just keep doing what I'm doing.

Any advice?"
pilates,Terrible neck pain when using jump board,"Hi all. I’ve been doing pilates for about a year now, with jump board sessions sprinkled in every now and then. Sometimes it gets intense and the next day I’ll wake up with a strained neck (usually the right side) and a headache all day. I had a session on Friday and now it’s Sunday, but I’ve still got a headache. Is there any way to lessen this? I like jump board just fine, but I worry about these sessions because of the aftermath. The headache and neck pain leaves me lethargic and unable to do much the next two days."
pilates,Will Pilates help my back pain?,"Bit of a back story… I have been semi fit from doing cheerleading as a teenager and I exercised on a less consistent basis after that but stopped all exercise when I got pregnant in my mid-twenties. Then 9 months after I had my first, I got pregnant again with my second child. So I didn’t exercise for almost 3 years. Before pregnancy and during pregnancy I had a lot of back pain. My physiotherapist said it was mechanical back pain, most likely from tight hamstrings. They didn’t have many answers for me. So I became extremely sedentary. Now I’m a mom to two toddlers, and I’m bending over A LOT, picking them up, changing diapers etc. my back pain is starting to return. So I’m looking for some relief, and to also lose the 40 pounds I put on these past 3 years. Will doing Pilates 3 times a week help with this? I’m just looking for some inspiration, tips/advice or your own success stories; as I’m feeling like something needs to give. TIA!"

pilates,Chronic Pain and Transitioning from Private to Group Sessions,"tldr: I have mild chronic pain in neck and shoulders. My core is weak. I have really tight hamstrings, glutes, and hips. I’ve taken private pilates sessions three times a week for a month. Specific exercises can be painful especially in my lower back. I plan to continue private sessions three times a week for about 2-3 more months. When can I start group classes? What should I expect in group vs private sessions (accommodations wise)? Should I increase the frequency of my sessions?

I’m (19F, 4’11 and 135 lb) pretty lazy—never into sports and have lived a pretty sedentary lifestyle all my life. I’ve had mild chronic pain and tenseness in my neck and shoulders for around 4-5 years, and I experience frequent dizziness and tension headaches. I also have poor posture and rounded shoulders. I tried physiotherapy, but since I move twice a year I only get to do it for a couple of months (if that) at a time. They recommended I continue doing my physio exercises at home and get a deep tissue massage once in a while when I don’t have access to it. Other than that, I started doing pilates as a way to keep me moving, reduce tension, gain strength/flexibility, and lose some weight (but it’s not my one of my main goals for pilates). While doing pilates, I learned with my trainer that I have pretty tight hips, hamstrings and glutes that make specific exercises (like putting my legs in table top) difficult and sometimes painful especially in my lower back. The issue is that since I’m so tight, sometimes I physically can’t do the modified versions as well. I know I have a weak core and I’m working to fix that through pilates as well. 

I’ve had around twelve sessions of pilates so far (3 times a week for a month). I plan on continuing three times a week for as long as I can. I’ve been taking private sessions, but I don’t think it’s sustainable for me in the long run. Since I’m moving again, I’m also moving between different studios. I plan to continue private sessions for about two or three more months. Is that enough to start group classes? How big should the group classes get? Should I increase the frequency of my sessions? Is there any other form of exercise I should try out to help me achieve my goals?"

What are some tips and stuff that I should carry over into my daily life from Pilates? That will then positively benefit me.

pilates,Have your thighs ever went numb or have you ever temporarily lost your vision?,"So yesterday, in my chair pilates class, we were laying on the chair for a long time. First we did the right leg (we were doing a hamstring and glue exercise with a ball with our leg bent and the ball was in our knee crease area) and did two variations with the right leg and then we did the left leg. When we finally finished I stood up and realized that my thighs were completely numb. Only my thighs because my thighs were leaning against the chair so I guess circulation was cut off but all the other women in the class were smaller than me so maybe that didn't happen to them cause they seemed normal but I kept rubbing my thighs because I was concerned. numbness took a long time to go away but today is the next day and I'm fine now but I still found it highly concerning. Is that normal?

2nd thing, I'm not sure if my blood pressure was low or something, but we did a glute stretch on the chair (pigeon essentially) for both legs. First we did right, then left. When we finally got up I lost my vision temporarily. I thought I was about to be blind. But then it came back.

The programs I have considered are: Real Pilates, Power Pilates, and Gramercy Pilates.

pilates,Balancing Pilates with other exercises,"Male, aged 48. 

Back in December I decided to get serious about exercises. Figuring that a daily habit might be easier to keep than having to push myself, I chose a 3x a week bodyweight program and a 3x a week running program. 

I later switched from bodyweight to barbells but other than that have kept the regimen for six months. And it is working. I started off only being able to run than 30 seconds at a time. Now I can do 3 km nonstop. My barbell weights have similarly gone upwards virtually every session.

But the injuries mount. Occasional neck spasms have always happened to me once every year or two, but I've had three this year, and each stops me from exercising for days. I had my first-ever kidney stone in March. I hurt my wrist dropping a barbell in April, that took me out for two weeks. Lower back pain appeared when my deadlifts reached 90 kg, and I haven't dared attempt a deadlift in the three weeks since then.

Yes I am obese, but I started on a diet plan in April and have lost 3 kg since then. It is amazing how often I get told that I'm too fat to lose weight. Or rather, having gone to all this trouble to get off the couch, I should just go right back on it, ie diet without exercise, or just walk. (The couch potato diet?)

I made an appointment with a personal trainer to review my lifting form, though have had to keep postponing it due to the pains. I made another appointment with a physio next week.

Someone suggested I try Pilates. I went to a class at my gym and was, of course, the slowest and weakest student there. The instructor kept having to give me special attention - I had to sit cross legged instead of legs straight, blocks to support my head, knees bent instead of straight when curving to the side, etc. etc. Exercises that were supposed to stretch the core or back hit my legs instead. The instructor said that I seemed to have very tight hips.

Presumably, then, I have to do *more* Pilates, or some other flexibility/mobility exercise. My question is juggling this with other exercises. The instructor gave me a long lecture about diet (mostly stuff I am already doing) and advised against using YouTube videos, she said I needed someone present for guidance and corrections.

The gym has 1-2 Pilates classes a week, but they fill up fast and can be difficult to get into. There are local Pilates studios, but they are expensive. And I'm trying to figure out how often I should do this. Once a week? twice? three times? Could I do it on the same day as cardio or lifting, or would those need to be cut back? The instructor had no answers for these questions, she was surprised to hear I was already exercising 6x a week (at least while uninjured)."

pilates,Teachers with more than one comprehensive certification- was it worth it?,"Hi! I completed a 450 hour comprehensive training program about three years ago and have been teaching on and off since then. Overall I feel like the training was a great foundation and I am relatively confident as an instructor (minus the imposter syndrome). It was a PMA certified classical program at a local boutique studio that had a great reputation in my area, but unfortunately the studio was hit pretty hard by Covid 19 and has since closed and disbanded the training. I fear that the local reputation it had will soon disappear and my training will feel irrelevant, and I want a recognized name to back up my qualifications. Am I overthinking this part?

The other reason I’m considering pursuing a second training is to get some experience with contemporary methods. The training was *very* classical and some of the trainers expressed negative opinions about other methods… you know, classical is “real pilates” and everything else is just “flair”, no need to stray from tradition, etc. Despite this, we had one master trainer with a contemporary background (from the Kane School, I believe) and I loved her modules more than anything. I have also taken classes from a Stott instructor and I have learned something new every time. I feel like there is a lot more to learn and taking a second comprehensive course in a contemporary method will make me a stronger instructor, not because contemporary is “better” but because I’ll have more tools in the toolbox.

Has anyone done two full certs? Been trained in both classical and contemporary? Did you learn enough the second time to justify the time and cost? If anyone could share their opinions or experience it would be appreciated!"
pilates,"Yesterday, I fainted during Pilates","I've been working out for 6 weeks and it's been going pretty well (3/4 times a week, 2 hours sessions). Yesterday, I decided to try pilates, I entered a beginner class. Within about 10 min, all we did was get in the right posture, focus on breathing and be aware of muscles. Suddenly, and I was.. litterally just standing there, my vision went blurry, I felt dizzy, I knew those are my symptoms of fainting but I tried to hold myself, then before I knew it, I fell. Well I fainted for a second and maybe the fall woke me up, the coach told me my face turned too white. I left the class and all felt well in about 30 min or so. It was pretty embarrassing of course, but well, there's nothing I could do.

So I'm just wondering, is it something common? Is it the focus that could cause the dizziness? Or am I just overthinking it and it's just heat or sugar level or somthing?"

pilates,"Thinking of becoming a teacher down the line, but afraid I will not be good enough and too old.","I’m currently a SAHM with small children, but am thinking a couple years from now when my youngest starts school that I may wish to become a Pilates instructor.

  I started about four years ago but had to take about a year off due to COVID, and started back up again late last year.  Since day 1 I have been in love with Pilates; I love how it is simultaneously therapeutic and challenging, and what it does for the body.  

The thing is, though…I know I have so much to lean in my own practice that I feel like I have no business even considering teaching.  I’d be 40 when starting training, while most of my instructors have already taught many years by the time they are in their forties.  

I guess I’m just looking for honest feedback on whether this is something worth considering."
pilates,How do I find a studio with nice instructors,The studio closest to me is in a very wealthy area and I love the workout. But I feel very unwelcome when I go 90% of the time. These women primarily are the real housewives of LA type and the instructors constantly compliments the super thin people’s bodies and tell you to be and look like them which is a little odd to me. I had the instructor roll her eyes at me for not moving my ankle in the precise position she wanted (even tho I told her it hurt and I could not feel any leg stretch or tension that way). She then in front of the entire class belittled me after telling her it didn’t feel good and she said it’s my fault I don’t know how to exercise. I left feeling embarrassed and mad. I’m a fitness instructor and yoga teacher and I always tell my students to listen to their bodies. Just very confused if this studio is the norm or if it’s better elsewhere?
pilates,return to Pilates after abdominal surgery?,I'll be having a surgery on my abdominal muscles and I'm wondering whether I'll be able to return to my current Pilates practice at this level after recovery. Has anyone here had muscle repair? How was your practice different after recovery? Many thanks.
pilates,Struggling to keep up,I fell in love with pilates at the nobu hotel last year in london but the only thing that stopped me from taking regular classes is the fact that I can’t keep up. I feel like I’m so much weaker and unfit compared to others in the class. How do I fix this?
pilates,Is it still beneficial if I can't understand the instructor well?,"I live in a non English speaking country as a Native English speaker. I can understand the instructors basic commands, but sometimes it's too fast and intricate for me to catch everything. It's a 1:8 class (aka 1 instructor and 8 students). She goes around helping everyone but she has to help me a bit more sometimes since I don't understand everything she says. Do you think it's still beneficial? I unfortunately also look at my classmates lol to see what they're doing and try to mimic them. I feel bad having to look at them but it helps when I don't understand something to see what they do."
pilates,Plank Challenge for Pilates Instructors,"If you are an instructor and there are overweight/obese clients in the mix, I would encourage you to try the following:

Wrap 20 to 40 lbs of weights around your midsection. Hold a plank for 30 seconds to a minute. Then lift your right leg and left arm and touch elbow to knee. Repeat 10 times. 

This should give you some idea of what these exercises do to the back of an overweight/obese person."
pilates,Is there a list of all pilates moves/exercises?,"I am a beginner and really like to organize things and do my own way, it would be helpful if there was a list of all possible moves to combine in a flow.

pilates,"""Nutrition labels"" for YouTube pilates channels","I just released a new version of my (free) app that improves YouTube workouts.  It has a lot of the most recommended channels from this sub pre-loaded (but lets you load \*any\* channel). 

So like Move with Nicole, obviously, Robin Long, Lottie Murphy, Moving Mango, Isa Welly, Trifecta, Lesley Long, Flow with Mira, Jessica Valant, etc.

One of the things I was noticing is that its hard for new people to get into Pilates online because there are \*so\* many choices. So I added what I think of as ""nutrition labels"" for the channels. 

No sense in starting with Move with Nicole (for example) if your goal is to start with 10 minute workouts, because 60% of her workouts are in the 30-45 minute range. On the other hand, Robin Long is \*strongly\* weighted to 5-10 minute videos with almost nothing longer, so if you're looking for a 30 or 60 minute class experience, she wouldn't be the best choice. Both are obviously strong choices with hundreds of thousands of followers and millions of views.

The app automatically generates these labels for any channel, but you can see some samples below.

pilates,Pilates has changed my life,"So I am a trainee yoga teacher and have been looking at doing an extra form of exercise to help build my strength. I tried lifting and gym for a while but it just made me feel worse and not at ease with myself. I should mention as well that I have very poor circulation in my feet so being at a gym made my feet swell more. 
I’ve started doing Pilates 5 days a week and yoga every day (with yin and restorative as my weekend practices), I have so much more energy, feel strong in myself and feel that Pilates has helped me in yoga as well as alignment is a crossing over point for both practices. 

I know every single body is unique and different but I really feel like I’ve found what works for me and my body.
Also some routines I’ve struggled with and modified, and then the more I do them the less I have to modify and can keep up. I love seeing the progress in myself."

pilates,Should you warm up before a lesson?,"I mostly do at-home Pilates, primarily the Flow with Mira app. I often do Pilates about 1hr after waking up.

pilates,Are pilates workouts suppose to hurt the side of my knees?,"Hi all,

I’ve been trying some beginner mat routines and have been experiencing pretty uncomfortable pain on the side of my knees whenever I have to do any leg lift movements while laying on my side. I was wondering if this pain is normal since it’s unlike any type of pain/soreness I get when I do basic strength training workouts. 

It almost feels like my leg bones aren’t aligned properly so the movements feel damaging if that makes any sense. I can’t tell if this burn is typical, due to poor form, or there’s something actually wrong with my legs lol.

I’d greatly appreciate any insight."

I love pilates and I moved to the area by the park and now that it is summer I wanted to go there and do my pilates/yoga routine but omg I'm so conscious of going there.

Anyone experienced this and still managed to not give an f?

pilates,I’ve noticed that I’m crooked,"Hey y’all! I’ve been doing Pilates for 3 days, so a total newbie here lol. I’ve been following along to YouTube videos and I’ve noticed that I might be crooked? As in, I’m feeling more burn on one side, I tend to twist to that side when I’m supposed to stay straight, the knee on that side hits the mat first when they’re supposed to hit together, etc. I’ve also noticed that my waist seems more curved on that side. I was tested for scoliosis several times in school (about 10 years ago) and always passed, so I don’t think it’s that. Is this crookedness something Pilates can correct over time, or should I see a doctor about it? If I need a doctor, what type? Thanks!

I also stopped going shopping because I hate that you can see them in everything I wear.

I know what an important aspect of the practice that proper breathwork is and that it also affects how much your lower abs are engaging in the work, and I want to make sure I am getting the most out of my practice. Wondering if anyone has any tips or resources or breathing exercise techniques I can work on to better control my breathing?"
pilates,Should I feel different?,"I’ve been doing club Pilates for 30 days - finished 30 classes… but I literally feel/see zero difference. I was pretty much sedentary before joining CP. I love the concept of Pilates and believe in it 100%, but would be lying if I wasn’t a little bummed that I’m not seeing a difference in my body composition and also not feeling at all stronger. Would love some suggestions from this community as I really think Pilates is the right fit for me, just want to feel like it’s worth the time investment. 

I have been very focused on activating my core and other muscles, listening to the teachers cues and following suit throughout the classes."

I just started Pilates not too long ago and finished my 6th class. I’m noticing that my hips flexors hurt like a B!@!$ while doing certain moves. The positions are: frog position where we’re pushing out/in, from frog you push straight up then back and out almost like spinning a wheel then going into where we’re opening our legs to the side then raising them up to close then down. I start to feel my hip flexors burning and then I can’t even stretch it out or even go into a baby pose without them hurting afterwards. I try to push through but the pain gets bad where I have to stop and put my feet on the bar with the straps 🥲

pilates,New instructor speaking negatively about other instructors.,"Hi all! I’m in a bit of a pickle, I’m the lead instructor at a studio and have been teaching there for a handful of years now with no complaints. 

Recently, we’ve hired a new instructor who will be helping us open a new studio. He’s enthusiastic and has been challenging the clients (some have been saying a little too much but still).

I was told today that this instructor had been talking negatively to a couple other instructor about my class. He didn’t feel challenged and didn’t feel like by visually cueing clients that I was a good instructor. 

Now, I know I tend to care a bit more than others about technique, and sometimes I’ll show clients the form of the exercise if they are not immediately understanding my cues. But it’s just rubbed me the wrong way, I’m trying to not take it personally but it does feel like he’s come in and is speaking a little too openly about these things. 

Does anyone have experience with this kind of thing? I’m by nature someone who absolutely hates conflict but it feels like as lead instructor I may need to address it. Or - do I just chalk it up as a loss, this instructor might just not like what I’m offering and it’s fine. Maybe it’s just both our egos bumping heads."

pilates,Pilates and gym combined?,What are your workout plans/routine like? I want to combine lifting and Pilates.
pilates,"For gym-goers who incorporated pilates into their routine, how often do you do each activity?","I'm a pretty avid gym-goer myself, I usually go 6 days a week and mix up what I work on. I work with a personal trainer once a week who monitors my progress and helps me build out my routine - for the rest of the week I cycle upper and lower body accordingly, with a cardio or core-focused day here and there to break things up. I've always loved the gym but I've been really committed for the past 7 or so months and have gone from thin to strong.

I had tried a few pilates classes in the past but wound up investing my money in the gym and a trainer. However, I was traveling abroad last month and wound up doing reformer pilates exclusively as my only ""workout"", pretty much daily.... and I loved it. I saw a change in my body quite quickly. I was already at a perfect weight and body fat percentage but I just saw myself lean down in general. I also felt great, limber and balanced, whereas I'd sometimes feel ""creaky"" after a week of lifting.

When I came home and saw my trainer again he was eager to test whether or not pilates maintained my fitness or depleted it over that month. To his surprise, my core was exceptionally stronger (it was already strong to begin with) and my overall strength had stayed more or less the same. The biggest difference that I noticed was how it actually felt to lift weights, I had absolutely no pain with deadlifting, which I was experiencing prior, and all of my movements felt smooth and controlled. 

I love the results that I've achieved so far and I want to incorporate reformer classes into my regular weekly routine. One thing that I'm particularly interested in aside from the functional benefits is the prospect of leaning down a little. I love the gym, my trainer, and my routine but I've noticed myself getting a little bulkier than I'd like. I know that I won't get super bulky since I'm a woman but I'd still just like to be a little leaner. I think that the puffiness can also be related to the stress that lifting and harder workouts put on the body as well... whereas I usually feel leaner and less bloated after pilates.

So I've done a 100% gym-based routine for a while, and I did a 100% pilates-based routine for a month, what will happen when I put them together? How often should I do one or the other to see the results that I want while still maintaining strength?

Ultimately I want to keep all of the muscle and strength that I've managed to build but just lengthen and lean my body out a little, while also getting the functional benefits of movement in both the gym and daily life.

For anyone else who does both, what have you found to be the best split?"
pilates,Update: Sharp Stinging Pain in Right Traps,"Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pilates/comments/uqpb9b/sharp\_stinging\_pain\_in\_right\_traps/i97mipn/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/pilates/comments/uqpb9b/sharp_stinging_pain_in_right_traps/i97mipn/?context=3)

I posted about muscle knots constantly forming mainly on the right side of my back and a sharp and constant stinging pain between the muscles in my shoulder blade and spine. I have tried foam rolling and massage balls, but that pain would not disappear.

&amp;#x200B;

My insurance cleared me to see a chiropractor and my results were... Disc-related problems. I had an x-ray taken and instead of a healthy c-shaped curve, I basically had a Z. Not even a straight neck; it's a Z. My fifth and sixth discs especially are bad and are bent in the wrong direction, which was the primary source of pain in my back. IIRC, according to my chiropractor, problems with your third and fourth discs will cause similar pain in your upper neck, and problems with your fifth and sixth discs will cause pain in your lower back. Thankfully, I have herniated nothing, but I was dangerously close to doing that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my first session was relieving those muscle knots. It turned out that I should have been relieving the surrounding muscles, especially those in my upper neck and chest, because doing that really made me feel a LOT better.

The rest of my sessions will include posture correction and I am in to receive around ten sessions in total. And of course, I will have to practice good posture and stretches regularly for this to not happen again.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to share my progress since you guys were so thankful. I'll be posting again later, thanks again.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr

1. Disc problems caused stinging pain between back and shoulder blade
2. Massaging/foam rolling areas in areas where muscle knots form will make you feel a whole lot better"

Many people don't understand what it means to be a Certified Pilates Instructor - to teach on the Reformer (as well as the other equipment), you must complete a comprehensive certification, usually around 500 hours total, which can take a year or more. There are hundreds of exercises to learn in the Pilates repertoire. This is part of why Pilates (true Pilates) is so expensive; the instructors are more thoroughly trained than any other fitness modality. The SolidCore/Lagree instructors are trained in as little as 1 weekend and do NOT learn any of the Pilates repertoire nor do they have any anatomical training. 

Just wanted to clear this up for those who might be new to Pilates because it can be confusing. But just using a Reformer or a Reformer-like apparatus doesn't mean that you're doing Pilates."
pilates,Query about trainer certification,Hello! My partner has a job that requires us to move around.

pilates,Pilates Teacher Trainings NOT on Saturdays?,"Hello, 

I'm in the process of becoming ACE Group Fitness certified and am looking into Pilates teacher trainings too.  I'm located in New York but I'm moving to Pittsburgh in the summertime (don't think I have enough time to complete the Power Pilates training in New York before I move).  Most importantly, I can't do program that requires participation on Saturdays.  Of course, I'm also looking to do only a well-recognized training program that the industry trusts.  I was really interested in Stott, Fletcher, and Basi but can only seem to find ones that are either on Saturdays or don't have anything near Pittsburgh.  I could travel for a training, if truly necessary.

Ideas or suggestions, anyone?  Thank you!!!!"
pilates,AeroPilates Chair in professional studio,"I’ve never experienced an Aero Pilates chair. Is it an affordable alternative to other split pedal chairs from brands like Balanced Body and Peak?

I've averaged less than one a week for a month. 

Are there any tips and tricks besides 'just show up and do ten minutes'? I do do personal training sessions weightliifting twice a week (though I'm recovering from a damaged tendon/ligament right now), and my work is fairly gruelling because I'm on my feet teaching for seven hours a day meaning that I come home exhausted every day."

pilates,"Not to disappoint people, but I want to share with the sub that it's possible to NEVER see any physical changes from pilates.","So, I feel like a lot of people on this sub want to know when they're going to see physical changes and results with pilates and I want to share my own experience as someone who worked out A LOT for 4 years straight and NEVER truly saw physical changes to my body from pilates and diet alone. 

In college, I started as a dance major and was a pioneer for the pilates certification program at Mt college in my 3rd year. During the 4 years I went constantly, I took at least 4 days of classes with at least 2 1 hour classes a day (if not more) AND dropped in the pilates lab for lab hours at least once or twice a week for 30 minutes to 2 hours of additional practice (especially when we started student teaching). I will start with the fact that I am a shorter, stockier female who has never been thin or had a flat stomach. I remained the same weight and looked practically the same during those 4 years.

For me, what changed the most was all internal. I had way more abdominal strength and learned how to actively engage ALL of my abdominal muscles during certain exercises or dance on cue. I went from being terrified to try anything inverted in a dance class to loving being able to do handstands because now I could reach a point where my abdominal muscles carried my body more easily. I had way more control over my body. As a naturally clumsy person, I found that I was able to learn how to fall more safely and felt stronger/like I wasn't going to break a wrist from falling which gave me more motivation to try things that scared me. I was able to do more ballet work because I could easily stabilize on one leg. And most importantly, my biggest gripe with my body is that I've always felt like I'm built like a turtle in that I have a very short neck but big ass head and broad shoulders so I naturally crunch my cervical spine. With pilates, I was able to get focused exercises and stretches to both lengthen and support true cervical spine elongation. Not to mention the fact that my posture was finally gorgeous and I did not suffer from the back and ankle problems that I do now. I never saw physical changes, but I absolutely felt the benefits of it.

And honestly? I know that I'm not the only person who experienced this. I know quite a few people who I did both programs with that said the same thing. We all saw immense benefits from doing pilates but we didn't believe that we saw the type of results I feel like a lot of people on this sub are looking to see. 

This is not everyone's experience. A lot of people DO see physical results from pilates, but as someone who worked out consistently for years and worked with people who did the same, I wanted to just share that it is possible that you'll never see the physical results you want to see with pilates and diet alone.

And that's okay. 

But, don't let it disappoint you."

pilates,I am the founder and CEO of the connected Pilates company Flexia - AMA,"Hey everyone!

My name is Kaleen and I’m the founder of Flexia.  We help people build strength, flexibility, and mindfulness with our smart Pilates Reformer and online studio of classes.  

You may have seen us mentioned in a few posts here and there, and I wanted to say hello myself!  This community is referenced again and again by some of our customers as a fantastic resource for their practice, so I wanted to take the opportunity to jump in and answer your questions about Pilates, Pilates equipment, and how we’re using technology to quantify the Pilates Reformer experience.

Quick background on me: I’m a mechanical engineer, Pilates instructor, and former owner of The Fit Reformer, a Pilates equipment maintenance company.  I used to work for a major Pilates equipment brand as an engineer.  I’ve been teaching Pilates since 2014 in a studio setting, and getting my hands dirty on Pilates equipment of all brands since 2015.

I started Flexia to make Pilates on a Reformer more accessible at home through three mediums: 

1. A professional-grade Reformer that fits more body sizes and has some home-friendly features (like wheels and the ability to stand on end for storage).
2. An online studio of scalable, intelligent, inclusive classes of varying lengths, skill levels, and focuses to fit where you’re at.
3. Technology that senses carriage movement to provide you real-time feedback specific to each exercise, track your progress, and make smart recommendations about what to do next.

I welcome your questions and look forward to chatting!

pilates,Why do I sweat so much in pilates?!,"I've been doing pilates now for 7 weeks, I've done about 13 classes that are 45 minutes long but in every class I'm drenched in sweat, literally beads running down my nose.

But it got me wondering...what SHOULD Pilates feel like? Are you supposed to be sweating? Muscles trembling? Heart rate up?

I’ve been lifting weights 5x week for the past 15 years (doing heavy-for-me compound lifts like squats, deadlift, bench, shoulder press, etc) and I walk 10k steps a day, so I think maybe I’m used to more intense workouts? (I’m taking a break from lifting and trying out just Pilates for a while)

During Pilates I don’t sweat, heart rate doesn’t get up, and I leave feeling like that was pretty easy.

But..I don’t know how you’re *supposed* to feel after Pilates!"

I am thinking of purchasing a tower retrofit for it, but was wondering if the mat conversion is necessary or could I get away with just purchasing the tower?  I have a BB Contrology Folding Mat on order, so I would only be using the mat conversion on the reformer, not on the floor.  I have never used a tower, but often use a springboard.  If you have a tower with your reformer, do you use it often or is it something that you would pass on if you had to do it all over again?

Still deciding if I am going to get the tower - I have an uninstalled springboard and I would probably sell that if I ended up purchasing the tower.  Decisions."

I know working out isn’t only for aesthetic purposes but I also really wanted to like myself a bit more. My doctor told me I shouldn’t lose anymore weight but I still don’t like the way I look because I’m very jiggly(especially my thighs).
I do pilates at least 3 times a week(sometimes 4) and only allow myself one 10 minute workout, the rest are at least 20 minutes. I also go to dance class twice a week.

pilates,"Home Machines: A lower Merrithew SPX or a ""normal"" Peak Pilates","I've been going back and forth on home Pilates machines for months now. (I, of course, regret waiting with the supply issues and now price increases by BB.) 

I like what I hear about Align Pilates--but with it being a mainly European brand, I worry about parts/springs.  


The Merrithew SPX package on Costco can't be beat (especially as one gets the Costco return policy), but I hate how low it is. I'm used to an Allegro 2 FWIW and I have no idea how that lower height will affect me. I can't afford, though, an additional $1000 for the height I want.  I also love the cardio tramp, something I had on my old AeroPilates from years and years ago. (Is a jump board just as good?)  


Trying to figure how insane it would be to put the SPX up on blocks (cinder blocks, yoga blocks, ?) just for those exercises.  


Of course, I'm also looking at the Peak Pilates casa and fit reformers. Leaning towards the Fit due to the wheels (which I have no idea if I'll never need, but if I don't have them, I of course, will need them.)"

pilates,Balanced Body releases price increase,"Just got this email and I'm kind of surprised it has taken them so long to increase prices, as it was inevitable.  I work in commercial construction and the prices are insane, as well as long lead times.  

Here is the email: 

""As I’m sure you are aware, prices on most goods are rising due to increases in material, transportation and labor costs. All manufacturing sectors are impacted. While Balanced Body has worked tirelessly to minimize our cost increases, we are not immune.

We are experiencing unprecedented cost increases in our supply chain and in transportation of materials and components.  Necessarily, US labor wages have also increased to offset rising inflation while at the same time we’ve grown from 270 to 304 employees in our Sacramento, California office and production facility.

To put it in perspective, the following are a few of our very real, tangible examples. These cost % increases are over the same costs in 2020:

* Labor – up 25%
* Aluminum – up nearly 250%
* Equipment Components – up +40%
* Plywood – up 60%
* Hardwood - up 50%

Unfortunately, this continuing cost pressure is now forcing us to raise prices. Effective immediately, you will see the new pricing on [www.pilates.com](https://e.customeriomail.com/e/c/eyJlbWFpbF9pZCI6IlJNV2VCZ01BQVlCTjFJbVo1RUJGUjl4RkVTNUdkUT09IiwiaHJlZiI6Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cucGlsYXRlcy5jb20iLCJpbnRlcm5hbCI6ImM1OWUwNjE5YTlkYzAxZGFiZjJmIiwibGlua19pZCI6MjMzNH0/30d61976a21141f18c9f6d893e9e49375a6672ace228ac3eedf08b9fad678cb2)  and hear it from your account manager. The price increases are on average 15%. There are a few outliers that are more, driven by a certain material(s) required in their build. **Please note: We will honor pricing on all submitted orders currently in our system.** 

We understand these price increases are significant. We wouldn’t be undertaking them if not necessary. Balanced Body has always been committed to making our equipment in the USA, using domestic suppliers, and providing the highest level of onsite customer service.

I'm just feeling lucky and glad that I pulled the trigger to get a studio reformed before this happened.  I paid $3,655 on March 11, and now on their website the same machine is listed at $4,400 (20.38% increase).  Did anyone else also purchase in time before this increase??

pilates,"Maybe I'll try pilates, but have some questions","So in terms of exercise, I've never been the best at it and was always a cardio person rather than a strength/ muscle person. Giving Covid getting worse where I live I have been too afraid to go to the gym to my dearest friend - the treadmill, and basically have only been walking as my daily exercise. 

I decided to do some of those at home workouts recently, and I always come across pilates on youtube. I've always had noodle arms (very weak), I'm speaking getting sore the next day from carrying mattresses for a couple minutes level weak, and I was wondering if pilates can help with this, I genuinely don't know anything about it so would appreciate if you excuse my ignorance.

So basically what I want to know is, does pilates increase strength especially in the upper body (I'm not looking for increase in mass though I don't mind it, for me strength the most important thing)? I'm thinking of going pretty intense for 5 months-ish before school starts up and I get busy again, and would like to see some results by then.

If so, any dietary recommendations to maximize the strength gaining benefits from the exercise? I do not want to count numbers since that shit is very toxic to me though.

Finally any beginner video recommendations?

Thanks in advance :&gt;"
pilates,What is the vibe of pilates instruction/motivation by trainers?,"I went to my first pilates class yesterday. I’ve been wanting to try pilates for some time, as I thought the nature of the exercises would help with my posture/back pain considering the focus on lengthening and core strength. Also, I’ve heard a lot about how it’s overall an excellent workout.

The workout itself was fine - only 30 minutes, and I’m sure there was a lot more I could get out of it as I learn correct form over time, as the micro positioning of your body seems likely to have a big impact on the workout effectiveness. But I found a lot of what the instructor had to say to be off putting- “this exercise is GREAT for lifting and building that butt ladies! You want that tush to be not just large, but lifted!” “This works the triceps, and I know EVERY woman wants to have better looking triceps!!” “Now as you do this, think about that summer bod! It’s coming up quickly ladies, don’t you want to be looking long and lean when you hit that beach?”

My question is: should I expect this kind of speech focusing on what the exercise will do to my visual attributes from any pilates class? Like that whole thing of “you should want to be shrinking the waistline, shrinking the arms, lifting the butt…” is that all very common for instructors to focus on? That kind of rhetoric is the opposite of motivating for me, and I don’t think I would go back if that’s a main feature of the program."
pilates,For women - did your physique get more feminine with pilates?,"I am new to pilates, last year I started weight training, not with heavy weights, at most 20 lbs, however I seem to put on muscle easily, especially on my legs.

I enjoy weight training, however I would prefer a model-like physique, I want to lenghten my muscles and get in tone with my body and I always hear stories about girls who quit weightlifting and got more feminine with pilates.

One thing I noticed about CP is pricing isn't listed online and I understand that it seems to vary location to location but they also told me over the phone they would discuss it in person at my class. That seems weird because most pilates studios in my area just lost their class/membership options on their site. 

Anyone have a ballpark on what they pay? I just don't want to go to my class and get blindsided. I'm looking for a 3 month or annual 3x weekly or possibly unlimited."
pilates,Looking for online Pilates recommendations,"I have been following Blogilates for over a decade and have always seen the best results with that + 80/20 clean eating and some cardio. I go through phases without it but always return. 

However, I a) find some of her content counterproductive to having a positive body image / a little annoying and b) wish it burned more calories without having to add cardio.

I like Boho Beautiful pilates content as well and find it a little “safer” since it’s less reps, but I wish it had tailored days per muscle group like Blogilates.

I’ve been using a heating pad, and I think it’s been slowly getting better, but I’ve been afraid to exercise, lift weights, etc in case I exacerbate it. 

Are there exercises I can do to help recover? And how can I avoid injuring myself like this again? I’ve been told I have a flexible lower back but stiff upper back, which can influence my posture.

However, the nearest pilates class is over twenty miles away; I have no mode of transport to get there, and taking the bus would take far too long. 

I'm well aware there are pilates programmes and such online, but given the emphasis my therapist put on using an in-person class for cues and corrections etc., I'm wondering if using online resources would be useful at all, or more dangerous?

Thanks for your feedback."
pilates,How long will I see results from Pilates 20 mins a day?,Hi all. I had some medical issues related to long covid come up and used to lift weights and do intense cardio. I lost all of that while I was recovering. Pilates is one of the only workouts I can do and right now they’re recommending 20 minutes. Is there any way I can see tone from that?

pilates,Knee pain from feet in straps?,"I'm relatively new to Pilates, but I've been going to reformer classes a couple times a week for the past 2-3 months. Lately I've been noticing a little bit of knee pain after feet-in-straps exercises.  Is this common? Am I maybe locking my knees too much when doing feet-in-straps leg circles? But legs are supposed to be straight, so I'm not sure how not to lock them in straps...any thoughts?"

pilates,Side pain,"Hi! I’ve recently been looking into taking Pilates classes because I’m 100% a beginner. I’ve had this pain in my side (right near my obliques and QL muscle I’d say) for 2 years and it’s affecting my quality of life. I’m working on getting a CT scan soon to be sure of what’s causing this, but if it is a muscle issue could Pilates help me with this? I’ve tried stretching and yoga but nothing seems to give me relief. I want to get stronger so I can finally get rid of this pain."

I’m losing weight and want to also tone(sp?). My plan is to do Pilates twice a week. (Mondays and Sundays) and run the other 5 days. Will I still see results? 
Also please tell me what you love about this? I don’t mind spending the money but I’m wondering if it was worth it."
pilates,Weights to Pilates?,"I have been lifting some dumbbells for about 2-3 years now. I have seen some positive and negative affects from strength training.

pilates,From no working out to Pilates,"I haven’t exercised consistently in several years—mainly because exercising gives me a lot of anxiety, which is ironic considering exercise eases anxiety. 

I’m heading to Greece in May, and would love to become more toned. I would love to try Pilates, but I don’t know if I’ll be strong enough to do the class. Should I work out in other ways before going? And if I do go, is this something I can do every day? Or do I need to wait in between classes to have my sore muscles heal? 

Appreciate any counsel."
pilates,Home reformer setup—did you protect your floor?,"Hello all! 👋 I am wondering if anyone has advice on setting up a reformer at home. I am eagerly awaiting my Merrithew SPX Max, and am trying to figure out my home setup. I live in an 6th floor apartment that has new hardwood floors (parquet I believe), and I’m researching how to best protect them so we don’t end up with a fee when we leave. 

I’ve read that rubber flooring can be damaging to wood, so I’ll avoid that. I’m considering getting a rug to place under the reformer, but I’m not sure it’s necessary. Nearly all the photos I see online just show reformers set up without anything under them. (And with a rug, will I slide more when I use the jumpboard?) On the other hand, my downstairs neighbors may appreciate it! ☺️

I’m also considering small cutouts of a protective material of some sort to go under the legs. 

If you have a reformer at home, would you mind telling me how you set yours up—with or without floor protection?

Thank you!"
pilates,Allegro 1 OR Allegro 2,"I am a 35/M who has been practicing Pilates for 9 years now.  Since COVID I have been working out at home and at my instructor’s home, where they had an Allegro. Since my instructor moved, I am on the waiting list for an Allegro 2 reformer and I am getting a little exasperated by the waiting.  In the meantime, I have been doing Mat Pilates workouts and HIIT.  My question for all with experience with both machines, what one would you prefer?  I am thinking about just getting the Allegro so that I can get back to reformer.  I miss it a lot!

Thanks."

My arm has more mobility on the right than left. My face on my right side is more lifted and sharp while my left side is round and droopy. 

I’m curious if Pilates will help in balancing out my muscles? Would this be something more suited in private 1-1 classes rather than group classes?"

My goal is to eventually open my own studio and be a certified personal trainer.

pilates,Question for Instructors: How to get the most out of ongoing private lessons,"The instructor I've been doing weekly privates with for the last year is leaving the studio and I'm going to need to change to someone else. I've done groups with almost all of the other instructors but no one seems to have as nuanced an eye when it comes to alignment or the ability to modify for my specific needs. I may be somewhat limited in choice of instructor due to availability and so I'm looking for tips on how to get the most out my privates. 

If I had to explain my motivation for privates it would be 1) focus on form (what muscles I'm supposed to be using vs. what muscles I am using, dialing back hyperextension and habitual compensation, 2)  work on skills that aren't appropriate for group classes, and 3) rehabbing chronic injuries after flares occur. 

When I've taken privates with others, I can discuss what I can't do and what my basic modifications are, but I've had a hard time articulating what we've been working on (lots of abs &amp; instability?) A lot of the time I end up getting a standard lesson plan from someone's toolbox rather than something personalized. As a client, especially as client that is starting with a new instructor, what can I do to the lessons to help make my time with the new instructor successful?"

pilates,For true beginners are videos really enough?,"A bit of background- I never played sports as a child but have exercised (running, HIIT, spin) for a few years now. I’d stay I’m fairly flexible but no where near Pilates level. 

After learning about Pilates I really wanted to learn and dedicate myself to becoming good at it but I’m feeling discouraged a few weeks in. Someone on this sub (more than 1 person actually) suggested move with Nicole and I’ve been trying one of her beginners full body routines every day for 3 weeks. I love her voice and routine so far but I’m not noticing much improvement from the first day of starting to now (The routine doesn’t feel any easier) and I lack the range of motion to really do every movement to the fullest. In the past when starting a new exercise I notice the routines becoming easier within weeks so I’m curious if maybe I’m not doing this right. 

I’m wondering if a true beginner to Pilates can really self-teach through at home videos, or if I’d be better off starting at a studio and eventually moving to at home?"

I just got placed in a new job in a small town with no Pilates classes at all (not even mat!) and would like to buy my own. However, I will likely be in an apartment and may try to move to a larger city in 2-3 years.

pilates,Any Pilates instructors also gyrotonic/gyrokinesis certified? Is it worth it?,"For any of you that might be certified:
Is it actually worth it? Pilates instructor here who is really interested in getting certified;However I recently learned that it’s hard to market/advertise once you are certified. A gyrotonic instructor I talked to said that she doesn’t even teach it to any other clients (she mostly teaches Pilates ) as it is too hard to advertise and that they have sent her multiple cease and desist letters. Is this a problem? I assumed once you were certified you would be free to sell the product/make money off of it? Especially after investing in the education and equipment. There is such little information about it and it seems to be really controlled to the point that it’s not worth it to get certified.. what do you guys think? Is it worth it getting certified?"

pilates,Sore neck from reformer Pilates session,"Does anyone have any advice for someone with weak core and neck muscles dealing with a sore neck from my second ever pilates reformer class?

My neck feels stiff and sore, which I'm thinking is from my Pilates session. The discomfort didn't show for a few hours after and I had no issues during the class, but then when the discomfort came it just felt stiff and sore as if I'd slept poorly on it (even though I hadn't yet been in bed, nor stationary for hours since the class).

Now this is the third day and it's still sore. I have most of my range of movement, but its still a bit uncomfortable and hurts to look down and to the side.

Does anyone have any thoughts or feedback on what may be the issue?

I understand that Reddit isn't the place to go for advice and I will be mentioning it to my teacher in my next class, but just was interested to hear some feedback in the meantime from others who may have had similar experiences and what the issue was 🙂"
pilates,Pilates Vs Bodyweight and Core classes,"After about 40 pilates classes and I stopped feeling any pain and burn.. so I decided to progress to something else without using weights and my gym offers bodyweight HIIT and Core classes. 

Bodyweight and core programs feel like an expedited form of matt pilates, where 30 minutes of exercise is equivalent to 45 minutes of pilates - with very similar exercises. As a result, they are more efficient and you also get to do some cardio due to the higher intensity and speed. 

Is there still a reason to continue doing Pilates?"
pilates,Is my routine okay?,"I recently became interested in pilates, and I have been following Move with Nicole's videos on youtube. I started doing the beginner videos, but I found them a bit too easy so I moved on to the intermediate ones. I do 20-45 minutes of the videos 3-4 times a week. I also do cardio 2x a week.

pilates,Improving hip mobility for certain moves,"Kneeling side kick &amp; leg lifts are so hard for me because I cannot bring my leg to hip height! I have also tried it with a yoga block (I have a set at home), which helps a bit. The only thing is that I won’t always have access to the yoga blocks because I don’t carry them around, nor have I noticed them at the studios where I do mat sessions. It’s really frustrating because no matter how much I think I’ve worked on opening my hips, this move seems to tell me otherwise. I’ve been in PT for a few months now, but to be fair, I’ve never addressed the lack of mobility in this particular move. We’ve addressed my general hip tightness.

pilates,Finding a studio on a budget,"Hi yall! Recently took a Pilates class and LOVED IT! Really want to do it more but it is hard for me to find a gym at a good value. For reference I travel about 1-2 weeks/ month so it’s also really hard to commit to 8 classes/ month packages that can only be used at a single location. The CP closest to me charges around $200/ month for 8 classes. Any studios that offer discounts or tips on finding a better value on classes (cheaper per class options, studios with multiple locations, etc.)?"
pilates,Soreness,"People have asked about being sore after begging Pilates.   Yes, it’s normal to have some soreness.  However being so sore that you can barely walk and can’t go to your next class a couple days later is just too much.  Pilates takes time to learn. Strength takes time to build. Getting a workout that’s so intense that you’re in a lot of pain and can hardly move isn’t good.  It’s unfortunately common, too many teachers don’t take it into consideration that someone who’s really a beginner and hasn’t exercised in years or decades needs to start slowly.  When things feel like too much you can let yourself ease up, take a break for a moment, skip something that feels to intense.  It takes time to build up to a full fast paced class. Don’t be afraid to tell your teacher that you need to take it easy because you’re wanting to build your strength up slowly.  No one gets stronger from one killer class, it’s doing the work consistently for months, years.  Let yourself go at a pace that feels safely challenging, not desperately overwhelming!"

I’ll start.. I am focused on increasing my shoulder girdle strength (and core, hip/glute/thigh strength of course), mostly to keep up with my hefty toddler who still loves to be held often. 

I am loving:
* Front/back rowing series &amp; long stretch series/planks on the reformer (along with lots of variations)
* Hand and forearm stand pikes on  reformer and floor
* One legged bridge variations on reformer and floor

Makes me feel like I’m getting sooo much stronger! I’m also working on my L-sit, although it’s more like “pre-L sit” work 😆 Definitely a lot more work to do there. 

Anyone else?"

pilates,Pilates Arc Musings,"So the FedEx man brought me a Pilates arc this week. I decided Sunday was a good day to try this puppy out. I’ve used the arc a little in the studio before, but this was pre-COVID. I have only been doing in home workouts with my teacher via zoom in private and small group sessions for the last 2 years. So I hop on the Balanced Body YouTube channel and find a quick 10 min workout to serve as my warmup before doing a jump board sesh. Pretty basic stuff - pelvic tilts, extension over the arc which felt great, single leg stretch. Then we get to a modified leg scissors and double leg stretch. Holy crap, it was so much more challenging despite the fact that my lower back and pelvis was supported. I think because my range of motion was limited I was focusing on the most challenging place in the motion where I have to really focus on deep abs. I have been humbled."
pilates,Pain when laying on the reformer,"Hi all! So I’m new to Pilates and am a plus size person. 

I signed up for classes recently (have gone 3x now) however when laying on the reformer I experience back pain from my tailbone hitting the pad on the reformer - the pain/soreness stays for at least 1-2 days after. 

Is this something that will go away eventually or is there something I can buy to help relief the pressure?"
pilates,adding resistance in smalls space,"Hi...

I've been working out less then a year and fluctuate between weight lifting and pilates and yoga. Sometimes I'll use the lightest weight I have with pilates, or ankle weights if it's leg day. 

But I've been looking at other ways to add resistance. I don't have space for a reformer. The main alternatives seem to be the circle thing, or bands -

--most commonly seems like it's the thin/flat therabands specifically that are used. Is there a reason for this?

pilates,Group Virtual Mat Pilates class?,Looking to see if anyone would be interested in taking a virtual group mat pilates class together. It would be with Nofar Method pilates. I took her virtual mat classes during the pandemic and she's one of the most amazing instructors I've ever had. You do need some props and it is challenging but leaves you feeling so  good and it's an amazing workout. It says it's 6 participants for $200 and an additional $17 for each additional person. You can check her studio out on instagram NofarMethod. She actually watches you during the class and corrects your form and makes sure you're doing the workout. I was hoping maybe to do this once with some people and maybe do it every so often if everyone liked it. Message me if you have any questions! Thanks!
pilates,I’m bad at pilates and I don’t know how to improve,"Hi! I (22F) recently (2 weeks ago) started attending pilates classes (and barre once, which I loved!) 2x times a week in a really great studio, with amazing instructors. I had no prior experience with pilates, and noticed how behind I am compared to other women in my class. When I do the exercises, I always try to listen to the instructions as much as I can but I seem to lack body awareness in this area, because the instructor often comes up and fixes my posture :’), which of course I greatly appreciate but I can’t help feeling a bit silly since this happens very often. This makes me a bit self concious, trying to focus really hard on copying the moves and not really enjoying it as much, or feeling it if that makes sense? I don’t know if it’s my posture or what exactly…
I really like it, I love the studio, but maybe you guys have some tips what can I practice at home so I can fully perform the exercises and get even better results? Any tips for beginners?"

You see I only do one video a day from move with Nicole and call it a day. Is there a specific program that you guys recommend especially for beginners? Do I need to do multiple videos per day or is one enough? For example, Chloe ting (not Pilates) has this schedule with multiple videos in one day. Is there something like that in Pilates world ? Also, do you recommend I start with the weekly challenges or just do beginners videos until I get used to it? 

I’m sorry I asked so much I just noticed that I don’t feel sore at all after workouts but during workouts I can feel my muscles burning. I read that multiple people feel the same and it’s not really an issue but I lowkey like the soreness after workouts.  I was thinking that it could be because I’m only doing beginners videos (I’m still stiff, can barely bend haha)

I would really appreciate any advice for a beginner. Thank you."

Especially when I do teaser/ single leg stretches. 

We stick to Romanas pilates as that’s what we love and prefer, but is this normal? 

My fiancé tells me when I exhale to push my rib cage into the floor and push my stomach into the floor. I do both and still some pain, but only when it arches. I can’t help it haha and I want to improve.

pilates,Pilates Instructors! Should I take the instructor classes?,"Hi Pilates Instructors!

&amp;#x200B;

Would just like to pick your minds a little bit on what made you decide to pursue your certification. I'm in the ""30% take the classes, 70% just keep practising but don't do the instructor training"" range at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit of a background:

&amp;#x200B;

I love the pilates practice. Been practising for 6+ years now. Have a reformer and chair at home. Do intermediate/ advanced online classes with an instructor 2-3 times a week; I follow YouTube videos as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no anatomy background whatsoever. The last biology class I took was in high school. I HATE memorizing things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lucrative career in supply chain. Can work from home, but my team cannot so I like to be in the office with them.

&amp;#x200B;

My country has a licensed Merrithew training center offering Functional Anatomy (30 hours in March), Intensive Mat (40 hours in March-April), Intensive Reformer (50 hours in April). This is their only class offering for the year for new teachers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can afford the classes (just under a month's salary for me). I don't necessarily need a ""return on investment"" either but it would be a nice back-up/ sideline. I did the math comparing potential earnings as a pilates instructor vs my job now, I'd have to work a lot more hours as a pilates instructor than my current role (already taking into account the non-paid OT I've put in since the pandemic). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My questions/ thoughts:

&amp;#x200B;

What made you decide to pursue a pilates certification? Did you have an anatomy/ teaching background before hand?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid I'd lose my passion for pilates if I am now forced to learn all of the cues/ terminology for the exams. I hate memorizing things. Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

Opinions on taking Functional Anatomy course online? A neighboring country's Pilates Studio is offering it in March (studio confirmed accredited by Merrithew to run the course)."

Doctors do suspect maybe fibromyalgia, but since i’ve been extremely inactive I’m not quite sure about this diagnosis. I really would like to change my lifestyle, and pilates does interest me. Can I start pilates now or do I need to be a bit stronger to start? Where do i start from? Right know my body is anything but flexible but i’m petite.

pilates,Advice for YouTube channels that do free pilates classes?,"I have been resorting to YouTube for exercise classes eversince 2020, and I actually prefer exercising at home in comparison to going to a gym. I started doing yoga with the Yoga With Adriene YouTube channel. But now I want to do some exercise that is a bit more vigorous, so I want to do pilates.

I've tried doing pilates with Blogilates' YouTube channel, and I like her exercise routines. The only thing is that I have very sensitive ears, and so I can't handle her talking loudly and highly energetically the whole time. It's also why I do yoga with Adriene, because her voice is softer and she doesn't talk too much or shout intensely.

Does anyone know of a different YouTube channel for pilates that is really good?"
pilates,Overtraining in pilates,"Hello, so I hope that I can find other pilates instructors or trainers in this group for some tips :) 

My question is, how do you keep up with all the group and individual training during the week without overtraining self and muscle atrophy? 

I am a trainer, I teach group pilates, pilates reformer and trx groups over 25 classes each week. Over a span of few months I got used to tiredness and muscle cramps, I don't feel it so much anymore and ofcourse that I try to save my energy in classes the most I can (ex. I only do few first reps to explain the excercise and than walk the rest of the set, or I only do a set on one leg and tell them to repeat on the other). 

I am eating my maintainance calories and watch my protein and carb intake. Supplemented vitamines also give me extra energy. I try to eat as many hugh protein snacks I can and also try to take naps during the day between classes, even tho I got none free time left after that. 

So yes, I did kind of get used to so much body stress and training but the thing is that sometimes I really feel overtrained. And also, I might got toned muscles but my muscles got smaller in volume because I don't have energy to weight train anymore. And I would really like to get a chance to weight train x2 times a week. 

I tried searching any science proved  tips on how to eat and adjust to the tempo so my body doesn't get so overtrained, but sadly found nothing. 

Any experienced trainer or instructor here to give out some tips? 🙂 

Thank you!"

pilates,Not feeling challenged enough…,"I recently joined the local franchise of a Pilates chain. I’ve taken 5 classes so far, mostly level 1 and today one level 1.5 “cardio” class that was supposed to get my heart rate up via reformer jumps. I am not being challenged by these classes, but I’m not sure about going up another level because I’m still new to Pilates and want to be sure I have the form correct. I’ve asked the instructors but they tell me to stick with it, and I’m feeling a little annoyed with the whole thing, like I’m not getting much out of my time and money. I also asked my instructor if perhaps I just wasn’t doing it correctly, like my form was off and stronger muscles were compensating, and she said my form looked pretty good….is this a common experience? It’s not like I’m in peak physical condition (I run a few times a week, but haven’t done strength training since pre-COVID, so I definitely have lots of room for physical improvement. ) Thoughts? Maybe this is what I get for joining the chain club?"

pilates,Emotional pain in chest after pilates?,"Hey all,  


I do reformer pilates in a class with a licensed physiotherapist. It's very gentle and I enjoy it. This week was a little harder as I felt a bit out of it. I am wondering if it's possible for pilates exercises to release/trigger emotional responses? I was doing a pec stretch and my chest is where I hold a lot of anxiety and tension. For the last few days since, I've been feeling very emotional and my physical feeling of anxiety in my chest is very present. Has anyone else experienced this? Did I go a bit too hard?"
pilates,Beginner to Pilates having a lot of muscle tension in upper back/neck.,"My upper body is already super tense. I am talking - you touch the muscles on my back, they are rock solid. It’s a problem and I am working on it. 

I do pilates 1x a week for school. This week has been particularly painful because my back and neck have started spazzing. Like a lot of knots and tightness happening. 

I thought doing Pilates would help but is it possible I’m going too hard during class? Or maybe it’s not a good choice right now? 
My neck feels strained easily so I am trying to be more mindful of that but it’s difficult keeping up with the class because of my overall body tightness. I don’t want to make it worse so I don’t know if I should keep going or drop the class or something."
pilates,Pilates is a practice,"People are often wanting to know how long will it take to get results from Pilates.  Many want to know why it’s taking so long to feel like they know what they’re doing.  Honestly there’s no answer because every person is so different!  

Pilates is a complex system with hundreds of different exercises!  It’s also a philosophy of fitness based on principles like breath, precision, control, etc.  it’s not supposed to be easy or be learned in a couple of weeks or months.  It’s a practice that was created to be something you do for life. Consistent practice is the only real key.  Nothing is learned instantly and nothing yields instant results.  It takes a long time to build strength and flexibility and change your body.  And Pilates is also about your mind. Connecting with your body and mind are much more important than getting toned abs or triceps.  

Don’t compare yourself to others. Just keep practicing. Try to enjoy learning and moving. There’s no rush. I’ve been doing Pilates for more than half my lifetime and I’m still learning and growing with it.  It’s meant to be a practice. There’s no recital!"

pilates,Shoes on the reformer,"I joined Club Pilates after doing classic mat for years and wanting to get into reformer classes. I did CP for about 1 year 3-4x per week. CP was hard on my feet and ankles. I blame myself for not being aware of this at the time, but all the fast dynamic stretching and quick foot articulation in my CP classes in socks only led to me getting pretty bad tendinitis in my ankles. (The teachers at the location I was attending moved very fast and I always felt like I had to keep up with their count). My podiatrist said I can still practice pilates, but to avoid the fast dynamic foot stretches in certain positions, and I also need to be wearing shoes instead of grip socks to have some kind of support around my foot.

pilates,What are your basic Pilates engagements? I teach that there are 7 to 9 integral engagements to the Pilates Method.,"Everybody knows 'belly-button to the spine'.  This can be cued in a variety of ways.  ""Pull the belly-button to the spine"".  ""Drop the belly into the floor behind you"".  ""Flatten the abdominal sheath as if you are putting on skinny jeans"" etc. etc.

This flattening of the abdominal sheath, the tightening of the transversus muscle (plus others), is taught in every Pilates class.  Or it should be!

It truly is one of the core or integral engagements that makes up Pilates and Pilates core stability…  We try and hold this flattening engagement through our entire Pilates work out. Even on our inhales.

What are the other critical integral engagements of the body that we should be maintaining through our entire Pilates work out?

As a teacher, I identify seven integral Pilates engagements.

Other than pulling in the stomach, what are your other integral Pilates engagements?

To me some are quite obvious, and some are surprisingly deep and obscure.

What are yours?

pilates,Does anybody understand the Pilates Breath? Does anybody actually do this?," Joe Pilates said a few things  about breathing.  Joe  said breath is the most important thing in his Method.   **The most important part!**

And  also, for Joe, the most important part of the breath was the exhale...  He wrote VERY clear descriptions of how to exhale for his Method.

For the exhale Joe said you must:

**""SQUEEZE every atom of the air from your lungs until they're almost as free of air as is a vacuum.""**

This is VERY clear.  Do you do this?  -- ARE YOU TAUGHT THIS?   Why not?

Joe said:

**""To breathe correctly you must completely exhale and inhale, always trying very hard to ""squeeze"" every atom of impure air from your lungs in much the same manner that you would wring every drop of water from a wet cloth.""**

Do  you do this?  This is a very clear image! Are you taught this? Probably  not!  But Joe said this is how to do his Method.    

What are your thoughts on Pilates Breath? Do you squeeze all the air out? Do you get that automatic 'bouncy' inhale that Joe talks about?

Am I the only person in the world who actually does this type of complete exhale? (I teach like this...). 

Does anybody understand why we breath in and out at certain moments of an exercise? There is a logic to it that goes way beyond just coordination and timing.

How do people breathe here? :)  Anything like what Joe said? Or?

I have an  'Eagle Eye' and it is razor sharp even over the internet. I give powerful corrections and suggestions. I work  slowly, safely and carefully. 

I spend a lot of time  teaching how to ""use"" the breath, rather than mindlessly just  'coordinating' or 'timing' it.

My  concept of the ""Circle of 6 Pilates Breath""  explains what Pilates  really meant about the breath.  Once you get the breath, the Pilates  Method opens up into a whole new world.

The  ease of movement.  The fluidity.  The huge improvement  in focus and  freedom promised by the Pilates Method, are all brought together by understanding the  ""Circle of 6 Pilates Breath"" (and my concept of the ""Integral 7 Pilates  Engagements"").  

I prefer to teach teachers, student-teachers,  and fanatics!   People find that their Pilates is often transformed after just one  session.

The freight company will only deliver to the kerb leaving me around 30m short of its final destination. I suppose I could tow it up on wheel but maneuvering will be very awkward. Might have to get some  furniture moving skids (trucks?) and a block and tackle system.

Have lived with this a long time and am well versed in exercise so not a complete newbie. Brand new to the reformer though. After my first two Pilates classes my neck &amp; back pain came back with a vengeance. I called Club Pilates who set me up with a 20-year instructor who was awesome. She has helped me tremendously and feel like I have nailed the low back pain issue. I believe my core is stronger.

My issue is my neck. My traps are killing me and I did the Center &amp; Balance class yesterday which was awesome and I think the issue is the arm work. Sorry I don’t know terms. Arms in straps reaching overhead and pulling down. I know to tilt the headrest up half way and I keep my head down on curls etc. I try not to strain my neck too much.

The reason I joined is that I would love to buy my own reformer so I wanted to learn properly and see if I could do this without injury. I’ve seen some negatives about Club Pilates &amp; am locked in for three months. There are not many options near me. Maybe I should just put in my cancellation notice now &amp; bite the bullet on my own reformer? This private instructor is awesome &amp; I could really work with her a bit. 

Thoughts &amp; advice? I go to Flow 1 tomorrow. Luckily I have figured out which instructors are good and tell them about my issues at the beginning of class. My alternative is to scrap the reformer all-together. I have Pelotons &amp; am fine continuing with their cardio &amp; strength programs."

The inflammation has gone down and i feel its healing but i cant tell the process is going to be slow. I still cant twist and the muscle feels very tight. I am not trying to overexert the muscle for at least another two / three weeks i want to make sure it heals fully. But in the meantime what do you guys recommend is a good start for physical therapy in order to start reincorporating light movement and strengthening. 
Any guidance or sharing of resources would be greatly appreciated."

pilates,Will pilates in addition to heavy lifting prevent me from getting bulky?,"Over the past few months, I’ve made an effort to go out of my comfort zone at the gym and branch into lifting heavy weights on a training program. I used to do a lot of HIIT, cardio, bodyweight and lighter weights, but I never really put on much muscle, also probably because I didn’t eat enough protein either.

Now, I’m really happy with my routine and progress. I go to the gym every day, alternating between upper and lower body, and stretching and cardio on my ‘rest days’ (I work from home so I need the extra activity). I see my PT once a week and we work on progressing my weights and do a boxing session.

I’ve seen more progress over the past three months than I ever have before, despite being an avid gym-goer for the past decade. 

One thing that I’m slightly nervous about though is getting bulky. I know that doesn’t really happen to women easily but it’s still something that I want to avoid. I really like lifting heavy and it’s so exciting to see as well as feel the physical benefits of just being stronger (everything feels lighter now!), however, I’ve noticed more muscle tone in the past from using extremely low weights and high reps. Now I can see that I'm actually *building* muscle rather than just defining it.

I did a few sessions of reformer Pilates last fall and really enjoyed it. I considered joining the studio and attending maybe three or four times a week in addition to my gym routine at the time but it’s expensive and I wound up putting that money towards personal training instead, which I've been really happy with.

I still really like the look and idea of the 'pilates body' and I'm curious to hear from others who do both lifting and pilates on how the combination has affected your physique, strength, and overall fitness experience. Would incorporating pilates into my routine help to define and lengthen the new muscle that I'm building? Will it lean me out in the process? From what I've been told, to really see major benefits from pilates you need to be going four-ish times per week, but since I already go to the gym, could I possibly see the same benefits from two to three sessions instead?

Would love to hear any advice or personal experiences with this!"

pilates,Pilates for the Inflexible,"I'm a beginner who's getting back into exercise after an extremely long hiatus (injury leading directly into COVID-19) and I, to put it lightly, am *very inflexible*. Sitting up at 90 degrees with legs straight out is a big challenge for me, my hips don't fare much better, and in general I've never been able to become a flexible person. Also, with that long hiatus I've lost pretty much all of my strength from my more athletic years so I'm at square zero.

I wanted to get into pilates because I've heard it being used in rehabilitation as a stepping stone for regaining mobility/strength and it's something I could keep developing over a longer period of time. My issue is that when I look up videos for pilates workouts, there doesn't seem to be anything catering to people who actually struggle with flexibility or have little to no strength - it seems to all be directed towards people who already have a baseline flexibility and strength to be able to actually do the movements without much consideration on how to get there from zero. his obviously doen't apply to all movements, but it applies to enough of them that I feel it matters.

I know this would be a *great* situation to get an instructor, but I 'm not in a good enough financial situation to attend classes right now as a grad student.

With that, I have two questions:

(1) how does pilates (specifically, mat pilates) used in rehabilitation differ from pilates you'd do in a studio or along with a workout video (if at all), and;

(2) how would you suggest I build up to doing certain pilates movements that involve a lot more flexibility than I have? I'm at a bit of a loss because I can't find videos that show much in terms of *progressions* to get to these movements."
pilates,Rib to hip connection,"I'm not exactly sure what I should be doing when I hear rib to hip connection. 

Do I flatten my back, do a mini an crunch, try and draw my navel to my spine, try and cup my abdomen region.

The more I try to make a rib to hip connection the sorer my lower back gets.

What am I doing wrong?

I do have a lack of upper back, pelvic and hip mobility. Working on that with a physio.
I probably have a small anterior pelvic tilt. 

When I go rollerblading, my lower back tales a punishment. Sore for often a day or two afterwards."

pilates,Bad Pilates experience..thoughts welcome!,"Just come back from a lesson feeling really flat and wondered if I'm being hypersensitive. I'm fairly new to reformer but have done a fair few beginners classes and been told by my instructor I was doing well and could easily join an intermediate class. 

Tonight I went to an open level class with a new instructor. From the minute the class started I felt uncomfortable with how much he was touching and correcting me compared to the others and that his tone with me was markedly different. At one point he came over and pressed hard on my ribcage and told me to pull it in, I explained I have a flared ribcage and my ribs naturally stick out. He snorted and said 'This one is going to be hard for you then' which I thought wasn't particularly nice. At one point we were widening our legs out with straps and he said 'Don't worry about hitting the person next to you. \[Person's name\] don't be afraid to kick \[my name\] on the nose.' Later when doing a plank he pointed out and laughed that I was shaking with effort. I could see others were doing some of the moves wrong too but he never corrected them with the same harshness he approached me throughout the class. I found myself wondering if he'd ever been bullied and whether I was reminding him of someone he didn't like. At the end of the class someone mentioned that they were a teacher and he said 'I was bullied a lot in school. I really wanted to do a Columbine and kill everyone but I never did, haha!'. So maybe my theory was correct.

Anyway, sorry for the rant just feel really disheartened when previously I was feeling really enthusiastic about finding a form of exercise I actually liked. Determined to go back but think will avoid him in future. Any thoughts welcome!"
pilates,Would like input on schedule/routine,"For my exercise routine, I currently walk and do pilates through Lia Bartha. I've been doing pilates since the end of September and have been enjoying it (was doing Barre3 prior to that). I'm trying to figure out a good schedule though. Would it be more beneficial to do shorter videos (30-45 minute) five or six days per week or 60 minute videos three times a week? If I do a shorter video, I typically walk for 20-30 minutes as well. If I do 60 minute videos, I don't walk on those days, but I do 45 minute walks on the non-pilates days. I sort of worry I'm not getting enough cardio/walking. Thoughts?"

pilates,88 year old client experiencing tingling and numbing in fingertips and arms - suggestions?,"Hello, dear Pilates community!  


I have a 88 year old client, who I train online, using ball and theraband as props mostly. She complains that any time she raises her arms up, there's a burning and tingling and numbing sensation all through the arms and especially into the fingertips. It starts from the neck/upper traps area apparently. We're doing a lot of the basic pre-Pilates movements, many of them seated, since it's hard for her to get down on the floor/mat.   


Do any of you have any suggestions as to what can be added to the repertoire to deal with that?"

background: I am currently a ""unlimited"" member of Club Pilates, paying $199 per month but since late last year I have not been able to make it to very many class sessions as i work 8-5pm and only have 1 or 2 class offerings after I get off work. I am not feeling like I am getting my money's worth.. 

anywayssss, does anyone have an at home reformer that has a screen for ondemand classes or live classes like pelton? 

what do you think of this new Frame Reformer that is coming out this year? I was seriously contemplating signing up for the presale at like $2499 i think but took too long and the presale ended. I think it looks great but i dont know much about at home reformers.

pilates,Club Pilates - a joke?,"I'm wondering what everyone thinks about the quality of Club Pilates?  
I think its a little sketchy that they don't list instructor bios or certifications anywhere - what's up with that?

Long Version:

I've taken a pilates class here and there at ymcas and other gyms throughout my life before, but have never really stuck with it. I am a classically trained ballet dancer and I have a solid grasp on alignment from having taken anatomy courses throughout my career in movement modalities. I was looking to add some injury prevention to my routine, which led me to pilates - CP wouldn't be my first choice but its geographically convenient and everything I've read complaining about CP is mostly about instructors not cuing good form and I figured I'd be safe since I know what I'm doing when it comes to alignment.  

I took my intro class, and due to their business model of how they sign people up after the intro class + being an awkward human when asked in front of others, I ended up signing their smallest contract (4 classes per month x 3 months.) I guess that should have been red flag #1. The woman who taught my intro class and my foundations class seemed to be very knowledgable and I felt like I was in good hands the whole time despite not feeling any kind of real challenge. I kind of chalked it up to the fact that I am definitely not average in this department and maybe need to take 1.5 classes now that I've finished my intro and foundations class.  But I didn't want to just skip right into a 1.5 from Foundations  without taking Flow 1 first, so today I took a Flow 1 with a different instructor. They were totally fine don't get me wrong, I just couldn't help but feel like, am I paying 30ish dollars per class for some random person with absolutely minimal training to teach this class? So I went to google to see if I could pull up the teachers credentials to see if I was just profiling the teacher because they were young and related to the owner. WELLL CP DOESN'T POST INTRUCTOR BIOS!!!

WTF! Any input? I was kinda hoping this was gonna stick, I could definitely use pilates in my life but....I'll do Alo Moves pilates videos if its really this grim at the only in person studio near me."

pilates,Megareformer Classes worth doing for a month?,"I’ll be in LA for a month and near the place I’m staying is a studio that offers classes on the mega reformer.

Are there drawbacks to mega reformer classes? Anything I should keep in mind?"
pilates,First ever class ✅,"Hello r/pilates! I just did my first ever class hence the title, and my body is feeling completely destroyed (in a good way haha). I was nervous about the reformer but it was kinda fun to use, the class was QUITE challenging but the instructor was really great about explaining everything. I kept having to double check which springs to use and with all the new info bouncing around my head I either forgot to breathe or wasn’t doing it with the movements. I’m excited to do this regularly, get better, and see what my body is capable of! 

It makes me wonder what your first classes were like? Anything you wish you would have known back then that you know now?"
pilates,Long Torso w/flexion injury...ideas for exercises?,"👋Hi there! New to this sub. Started taking Pilates instruction at the beginning of the pandemic.

💡I have two instructors who are amazing and we are working together to figure out how to keep my low back healthy. I'm wondering if anyone here can give us ideas.

Forty-seven-year-old female with a very long torso and short legs. I've been introduced to intermediate and advanced moves in private sessions. I take at least one private a week and usually take a mat class and an open gym with guidance. I have a lot of strength, at least in some areas, but I seek more even development of strength and control. My instructors are trying to focus my work on hip flextion (creasing) and core stabilization. 

This focus is due to the fact that I've recently had a series of what I assume are lumbar spinal disc injuries incurred while in flexion. These actually happened more frequently before I started Pilates, but have had a comeback recently. Side note: extension has never, ever been problematic. It tends to help.

👂Just wondering if there are folks on this sub that have experienced similar challenges or instructed folks with similar challenges. If you have ideas to offer, I am all ears!

🪑If it helps, I have access to the wunda chair, high chair, arm chair, cadillac/trap table, spine corrector, tower, pedipole, reformer, magic circle. I think they have everything!"

pilates,Choosing between 8mm mat and 15mm mat,"I would be grateful for some advice on mat thickness. I do pilates on a hard floor at home and have ordered an 8mm and a 15mm mat to test. I can see pros and cons in both. The 8mm mat is firmer and would provide better support for any standing movements - but there's not as much cushioning when I lean into a knee stretch. The 15mm mat feels great for my knees, but it's a lot softer and I'm wondering if there are any downsides to that, either during floor work or any standing movements, like pilates squats or any movements where you shift weight between legs. I would definitely like to return one as I have limited space - the 15mm feels comfier, but I don't know if there's a point where mats get so comfy that they don't provide enough support!"
pilates,Cardio workout suggestions?,"Hey! I’ve been doing Pilates for about a year now and I absolutely love it, but Ive gained some weight (from eating too much and being otherwise inactive, not from Pilates lol) and am still pretty out of shape in terms of endurance, so I feel like it’s time to add some cardio into my routine. 

Currently my only “cardio” is walking and biking, but neither really give me that much of a workout as I live in a very flat, hill-less place. I used to love running but it is too harsh on my hyper mobile joints. 

Do you have any suggestions for (low impact) workouts that would complement my Pilates routine and give me the cardio/calorie burn that I’m looking for? currently I cannot afford a second gym membership so options like orange theory won’t work, but I’d still like to hear about it for future reference."
pilates,Good virtual reformer classes?,"I have been doing Pilates for about a decade. I used to take in-person mat and equipment classes at a studio and felt really lengthened and centered after each class. In more recent years, I have been using Pilates Anytime (PA) videos for workouts on the mat and my Peak Pilates reformer and tower.

Last month I started a subscription to Lia Bartha's mat classes, and I find that her cues and methods recreate that feel I had from in-person classes. It made me realize that I haven't felt that way after PA classes for a long time. The closest I get to that feeling is with Benjamin Degenhart's classes, but there's not that many of them. So - Any recommendations for video instruction on reformer and tower with effective cues and relatively brisk pacing?"

- any time anyone mentions ""squeezing my inner thighs together"" (for example when going from laying down on my back to sitting and folding over my quads), or using the inner thigh muscles at all, I have no feeling of how to engage them. Any tips?

- from what I understand I should be engaging my glutes during planks/pushups but I cant seem to make it happen, and I worry its a lot of low back pressure (though I dont feel pain). Any cues for glute engagement in these positions?

3) Mat or Reformer classes?
4) Any studio recommendations in the San Diego area?

pilates,Which AeroPilates reformer for at home use? (Stamina 5-cord vs Premier Studio 700),"Hey everyone,

I've taken a few studio classes and mostly have been doing mat classes as far as my pilates routine goes. However, the classes are beginning to add up and I was wondering if anyone has any insight into the following two reformers: 

[Stamina 55-5010 Aeropilates 5-Cord Reformer](https://sport.woot.com/offers/stamina-aeropilates-5-cord-reformer-5)

[AEROPILATES PREMIER STUDIO 700](https://staminaproducts.com/product/aeropilates-premier-studio-700/)

Not sure how reputable how Woot is (they are a subsidiary of Amazon), but the 5-cord reformer is currently $289.99. The Premier Studio 700 is $449.00. 

For context, I would be looking to use it 2-4 times a week and I am rather short, so if anyone has had any issues regarding height with these reformers please let me know. I have checked FB marketplace for used ones to try out as well but there aren't any in good condition near me.

I have the 'Eagle Eye' and it is razor sharp even over the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a hi-level teacher, and prefer to teach teachers, student-teachers, and fanatics!   People's Pilates is often transformed after just one session. True.

&amp;#x200B;

I teach the breath with more focus than any other teacher I have met.

&amp;#x200B;

My concept of the ""Circle of 6 Pilates Breath"" really explains what Pilates really meant about the breath.  Once you get the breath, the Pilates Method opens up into a whole new world.

&amp;#x200B;

The ease of movement.  The fluidity.  The huge improvement  in focus and freedom promised by the Pilates' Method, are all brought together by the ""Circle of 6 Pilates Breath"", and my concept of the ""Integral 7 Pilates Engagements"".  You will easily learn to feel your new body as it creates Pilates core stability

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

As a teacher, I have I have an 'eagle' eye (I see everything!). I am talkative and clear. I give powerful corrections and suggestions. I work slowly, safely and carefully with my students. I spend a lot of time teaching how to ""use"" the breath, rather than mindlessly just coordinating or timing it.

&amp;#x200B;

Many advanced Pilates practitioners (Pilates teachers included) have found my breath work to be profoundly transformational.

&amp;#x200B;

It's FUN too. :)

\--------------------

THE BREATH - Joe said a few things about breathing.  He said it was the most important thing in his Method.  The most important part!

&amp;#x200B;

And also, for Joe, the most important part of the breath was the exhale... He wrote VERY clear descriptions of how to exhale in his Method.

&amp;#x200B;

For the exhale Joe said you must:

&amp;#x200B;

""SQUEEZE every atom of the air

from your lungs until they're

almost as free of air as is a vacuum.""

&amp;#x200B;

This is VERY clear.  Do you do this?  -- ARE YOU TAUGHT THIS?   Why not?

&amp;#x200B;

Joe said:

&amp;#x200B;

""To breathe correctly you must

completely exhale and inhale,

always trying very hard

to ""squeeze"" every atom

of impure air from your lungs

in much the same manner

that you would wring every

drop of water from a wet cloth.""

&amp;#x200B;

Do you do this?  This is a ver clear image! Are you taught this? Probably not!  Joe said this is how to do his Method.    (I teach like this...)

&amp;#x200B;

Joe Pilates was a very intelligent and educated man.  In his life he studied many many forms of movement, and came up with a tremendously important new form of his own: ""The Method"".

&amp;#x200B;

Joe also invented the most clever and most transformational fitness equipment ever! (I sell plans on how to build many of them, on sale now - 40% off)

&amp;#x200B;

So, Joe Pilates, movement genius, said the breath is the most important part of his method.  He even describes how to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

And it works! Teaching according to his suggestions is dramatically transformational.

&amp;#x200B;

My concepts of the ""Circle of 6 Pilates Breath""  and the  ""Integral 7 Pilates Engagements"" use the breath to link the mind to the body (the mind and body connection) and lead to a truly revolutionary breakthroughs  with cutting-edge ‘engagement cueing’

&amp;#x200B;

Learn to use the breath in a Pilates way! Thanks, Mark (PilatesBreath)

pilates,Pretty new to Pilates (mat and reformer) – loving it so far but having the greatest difficulty lifting my back/abs upwards (like a sit-up or crunch) without sending my legs flying or cheating using my hands to push me up. Will this change?,"Hi, I should say I've only started Pilates about 5-6 weeks ago, once a week, so I'm pretty new to it. I've been doing a combination of reformer and mat classes (did a few private sessions at first too).

So far I can feel it doing wonders for my back and spine health, and balance. But one thing I cannot seem to fix is the ability to lift my back up toward my legs, as in like a sit-up or crunch formation (I'm pretty much referring to mat pilates now). I'm not trying to compare myself to others but I notice in all my classes, I'm the only one who has to push myself up with my hands or kind of whip my feet in the air and back down to create a sort of momentum to push me up – but it's totally not graceful and possibly not the healthiest move lol.

I came to pilates in part to strengthen my core and develop awareness around all these muscles. But while my balance and posture seems to be immediately improving, I still can't do a sit-up or crunch or lift to save my life.

Is this something that comes with pilates practice – or should I supplement with other workouts or stretches to help me get there? Thank you!"

pilates,Why people tend to be dismissive of pilates?,"My dietitian was extremely surprised that I gained 1kg of muscle mass in one month only doing pilates (2x per week with an amazing instructor) and on a diet. In my first consultation, she said pilates wasn't enough, even tho I told her that I could feel all my muscles the next day and it was heavy. I ignored all her non-food tips/opinions, since she's a dietitian, and I got amazing results doing pilates. 

So why people tend to be dismissive of pilates? Everytime I look for opinions about pilates, even here on reddit, people keep saying that pilates isn't enough or is limited."

pilates,How do I become an instructor through Club Pilates if they don’t hold sessions in my state?,"Hi there, I may be confused on how it works, but when I looked up instructor certification through CP, it gave a list of states that were holding teaching sessions and I didn’t see mine there. Are those the list of the “host” studios where you learn to teach in person, or is that something different? 

And if it’s the case that I can’t certify through them because if this, do most people in this situation get certified through a different program such as STOTT to then become a teacher at CP?"

pilates,Curious about fully online accredited instructor training.,"Several years ago I did a mat 1 training course. It was 54 hours in a classroom at the studio I regularly attended as a student. This class was a prerequisite for mat 2,3, and reformer. I only taught several classes when I had time after, but I did not really continue as I was busy with my other job. I finally am in a place where I am able to pursue instructor training again. I found a fully online course called Breathe education. They seem to be based out of Australia (I'm in the US) but are the only fully online course accredited by ACE. It's a 21 week course and covers everything from mat 1-reformer training. I'm just wondering if anyone is familiar with this program or the concept of doing an online certification. It is around $5k and you need to purchase a reformer. I'd normally shy away from online but it's the only thing I have time for and I am very very experienced in my personal practice in pilates (10 years, 5ish times a week) as well as my mat training and a pilates fundamentals course in college. (I'm 27 now) if any fully certified instructors or others have any advice on how this sounds or if they have done it I'd love to hear! Thanks so much!"

I have hip dysplasia, and getting surgery will take a while, so im the meantime I'm trying to avoid further destruction of the joints. 
I have terrible posture (torticollis, sitting a lot) as well, which makes all of this worse, because it puts uneven pressure on my hips.

I at least want to strenghten my upper body, core and specifically pelvic floor muscles. I sadly can't do any leg exercises, though. 

Will only doing pilates exercises *without* leg movement still improve my pelvic tilt and maybe support my hips?

At the moment, it isn’t really in my budget to do reformer classes as much as I’d like to (ideally I’d want to go 4 or 5 days a week). I can probably manage 1 to 2 group classes per week at this time, but during the rest of the week I’d like to find a way to translate some reformer moves into my normal gym routine, using the equipment available to me.

So far I’ve been able to come up with some core stability exercises using an exercise ball, by putting my feet up on it in a plank position and doing slow, controlled knee tucks. I’ve also used the TRX straps for similar moves involving planks and mountain climbers.

I feel like the resistance cable machines have a lot of potential for replicating some of the reformer’s functions but I’m not sure where to begin!

I suppose I could incorporate mat Pilates into my routine but I’ve only taken reformer classes and I really like what the resistance does to my muscles and the way that it challenges my ability to maintain form and control, I’d like to try to replicate the reformer as much as possible!"

I’m interested in going to club Pilates but I have never done a Pilates of reformer (group) workout before. I’m maiming looking to tone up and gain strength in my abs and legs/thighs. I realize you can spot reduce certain areas of your body and nutrition is 80% of weight lost, but will Pilates help with these goals?"

I go to Club Pilates where they have cardio classes where you do a lot of jumping, so they legs hang down and it’s been putting a huge strain on my lower back. I’m wondering if anyone knows how to solve this? At the end of the day it hurts pretty bad and I chose Pilates to protect my back. Any advice?"

pilates,Ready for level 2?,I’ve been taking level 1 reformer Pilates classes for a couple months and have really been enjoying it. I feel comfortable with most of the moves we do in class but some I still struggle with. Also my flexibility is OK but not great. The biggest concern would be my lower back issues. It’s OK right now but leg circles can make my lower back feel more sensitive. I was working out regularly before I started (running &amp; weights) so I have a good baseline of fitness already. Should I try a level 2 class or will I make a fool of myself? Can I still modify exercises in case my LB starts feeling achy or weak?
pilates,Best reputable Pilates Certification programs for instructors,Looking into getting my pilates certification for Mat instruction but there are so many with varying prices and info so anyone who has taught what programs would you recommend.

pilates,Managing weight loss expectations,"Hi there!

Wind back to 2015 and I was at my lowest weight (55kgs) and wildly into Pilates. Given that I was already happy with my weight, weight loss was not really a factor.

Fast forward to 2021 and my BMI is more on the upper end of normal than I feel comfortable with (pandemic and wine, man). 

I have restarted one in one Pilates reformer classes (1 hour, 4 times a week). I would be really happy to lose around 5-7kgs; so not a huuuuge amount but not tiny either.

Going from a state of literally being a sedentary locked in potato to this level of Pilates, should I have any solid expectations for weight loss? I’m willing to make adjustments for diet but I guess trying to manage my expectations around just how much Pilates at that frequency can really help to drive my intended results."

pilates,Does anyone else not feel as worked with reformer vs mat?,"I'm not sure if I need to take higher level classes, that may be the issue. But all of my mat classes and workouts seem like they hit a hell of a lot harder than my reformer classes in terms of working out. I feel like I get more stretch with reformer though. Anyone else?"
pilates,Club Pilates success story so far,"So I’ve been a member at CP since June and started working there a few weeks ago part time, I’m 35 classes in…let’s say I’m pretty addicted. I’d love to take more classes but I get called in last minute to work. So I go 3 times a week (even though I wish I could go 4-5 times a week). 

I feel like I’ve gotten a lot stronger and more toned. I used to be a Pure Barre member. I have seen posts in other subs comparing PB and CP and people saying that PB is much harder, more challenging, gets better results, CP is too easy…for me I feel like when I did PB, I compromised on my form a lot because the moves were so fast paced and frantic, and I wasn’t feeling like I was getting stronger. For example, PB does a 90 second plank. Even when I was 200+ classes in I still couldn’t get through the plank without dropping down on my knees. I think a lot of it was because we did some weird moves along with the plank and I couldn’t catch up.

I take a level 1 class every Tuesday because omg the instructor is so hard, her classes are harder than some of the level 1.5 classes I’ve taken. I know taking her classes will whip me into shape. She has us do a 1 minute plank but because I’ve been going more, and because she actually cues on how to get the correct form, and because the planks are simpler (we can go side to side though), I can hold it all the way. 

My arms are also getting a lot stronger with the straps on the reformer.

Just thought I’d share. I wish I could go everyday! I would love to keep on going until I can get to a level 2 class. This is a workout I can see myself doing forever."

pilates,Overseas course advice &amp; Bachelor degree,"Hi everyone, 

I'm a new Pilates instructor in Australia, I was taught classical physio rehab Pilates in Mat &amp; Reformer. It was absolutely an amazing blissful course and my love for Pilates grew with a desire to learn more! I understand there is a contemporary form of Pilates but I have little or no knowledge of it.

I noticed Pilates overseas specifically Asia seems to be much more comprehensive with the type equipment and knowledge taught within Pilates classes. In Australia we don't run exercise classes for cadillac/trapeze, wunda chair and barrels. These equipment are mainly found only with Clinical Pilates rehab for Allied Health workers mainly Physios. It is my dream to teach with these equipment but I don't want it to be limited to just clinical &amp; rehab clients but for everyone. I really hope it can be taught as a form of exercise in Australia. Unless someone knows the reason why this can't be the case? Is it the same in other Western countries?

I've read that STOTT Pilates is the ""ivy league"" of Pilates training. I've been having a bit of a stalk on instagram and noticed many amazing people are certified with STOTT and some even travel to Canada to do so. 

I feel it is unheard of to travel overseas to do a Pilates course. Do you know anyone who travelled overseas to just to do a Pilates course? Would you yourself? 

It is something I am considering in future whether its Korea or Canada as its not offered here but I hope to get any advice I can at this point. Any thoughts? My goal is to expand my knowledge in Pilates and learn ""Clinical equipment"" as a form of dynamic exercise. 

Also if you had a degree to complement Pilates what would you choose?  IMO Exercise Physiologist fits my idea of building a exercise program, rather than a Physio being hands on with massages. But I have still have doubts as I've never heard of a exercise physiologist teaching Pilates as a method in Australia. Maybe you are in Allied Health and can enlighten me?  


I hope these questions aren't so silly I also mean no shade to anything or anyone. 

Thanks for reading."

A few exercises are very tricky for me (lower back, knees) so your guidance re anatomy and adjusting poses would be appreciated!","Hello! I am pretty new to pilates, I've taken a few mat classes here and there, done PT with a reformer and currently have a Pilatesology subscription I make use of 2-4 times a week.

Understandably noone is correcting me when I use video, but I have a couple q's about specific exercises:

1. Forward folds don't really jive with me, for example in yoga I always bend my knees and do the microbend or the easier, bent knee position in order to avoid locking in the lower back. I know it relates to tight hamstrings as well. I can feel the effects of back strain if I don't do that almost immediately and have even suspected a disk bulge, but i also have a sedentary job, so... But in classic pilates, can forward folds be modified too? is it ok to bend your knees or maybe even sit on a yoga block. For example the forward bend with legs mat wide just doesn't feel that great. What are my options.
2. The exercise of being on your stomach, chest and head up supported by arms slightly ahead of you while lifting legs up and doing leg kicks w knees bending to 90 degrees backwards - why does it feel soooooo weird? it's almost like the knees are not supposed to go this way. it's not painful for me but it feels like uncomfortable and odd, like pushing something in the wrong direction. is that a hamstring/low back issue? Is it ok to do the exercise with your knees down on the floor or perhaps not lifting the chest and head?

Thanks for any tips. I would like to book a few private lessons with an instructor soon because other than these issues, I am loving the practice."

Is Pilates strengthening or stretching or both? If it is strengthening, can I still do this every day? I thought we had to break down muscles to get stronger, but is Pilates intensive enough to do that, to actually gain muscle mass over time? If so, should I only do it three to four times a week?

I’m a member at Club Pilates and they are hiring for a part-time Sales Associate. I messaged the owner that I was interested and and she told me to email the resume to her, and she actually scheduled a quick phone call tomorrow.

pilates,Was this a rude question?,"I’m new to club Pilates, and I really enjoy it! I took my first full class today (after the intro class), and decided I do want to try to fit it into my workout routine once a week or every other week. I’m pretty active with another gym and sports, so that’s all the time I can dedicate. 

I don’t feel like the level 1 class was challenging enough strength or flexibility wise, so I wanted to ask the instructor if I could try a 1.5 level class. She explained that there’s more to it than strength with the mind body connection and what not, and to spend at least a month in level one.

The problem is, I think I offended her :/ she seemed snubbed when I said I didn’t feel level one was challenging enough. I tried to clarify and was emphatic that I loved the class,but it was kind of awkward. Was that a rude question? I feel like she took it personally. 

Also, I still really want to try a level 1.5 :/ has anyone moved up pretty quickly? Or should I stick to 1 for a while?"

pilates,Pilates mat classes,Pilates mat classes are very affordable.  They compare to yoga class costs and generally are much smaller class sizes than yoga.  People are always saying Pilates is too expensive but I never see anyone saying this about yoga. And most studios are doing mat classes through zoom now so you can take them no matter where you are.  You do not have to pay for private sessions to learn Pilates from a teacher.  Mat classes are the perfect way to learn enough basics to have your own practice at home and give you a good foundation for following along with videos and knowing how to make adjustments to your own form.

pilates,Sharing opinions,I post things here and I don’t care if you agree but being nasty is really uncalled for.  If you’ve got your own strong opinions or unique perspective then write a please do post and  share it!  But making snarky comments is really juvenile.
pilates,Videos as teachers,"I know.  Everyone wants to find a video to learn Pilates. 

Guess what?  Videos aren’t teachers. They’re not able to look at you and give appropriate corrections. They can’t choose what exercises are actually good for you and your individual needs.  

If you’ve learned the basics and don’t have any acute injuries videos can be great. You’ll have an idea about how you should be adjusting yourself from what your teacher did to guide you. 

As a complete beginner it’s just not an advisable way to learn. I’ve been teaching for a long time and all people have ingrained movement patterns that aren’t really ideal and in learning Pilates these patterns are improved through cues and adjustments made by a skilled teacher. Even with a teacher to guide this isn’t easy. Most people over correct or make aggressive changes. Our bodies get set in their ways and to make beneficial changes is a process and the cues and adjustments that make positive change vary hugely for each individual. 

The number of people on here struggling with various issues in Pilates exercises is telling in itself.  Joseph Pilates created an amazing system but it’s meant to be taught by a person who can see you and guide you as an individual.  It’s not the exercises themselves thst make positive changes, it is how you do those exercises. Once you’ve got a solid foundation videos are great… but they cannot replace actual learning from a live skilled teacher who is watching and guiding you. 

If you hear the words “pull in your navel” or “pull down your shoulders” your body will do something but Pilates is about finding deep and underused muscles so it’s pretty unlikely that you’ll actually be able to find a new way of moving that is completely foreign to your body from the words.  I see what people do with such cues and it’s rarely actually a beneficial change. Actually repatterning our nervous system and body mechanics takes real skill and there’s just no video that can do it. A truly skilled teacher can help you change your movement patterns for the better in ways that will serve you for life. This is the real true power of the Pilates method. Going through the 34 mat exercises and squeezing this and tightening that might make your body firmer but joints don’t benefit from tension. I’ve seen many people who did Pilates for years but had no connection or understanding of how to move in a healthy way.  After just a few sessions they had a completely different experience.  

If your a person who did just start Pilates with some video and it’s worked for you, that’s wonderful!   I’m just letting the ones who aren’t getting the results they expected know that maybe they think they’re not working hard enough or they’re not doing it right but some actual instructions from a live teacher might make all the difference.  

I’m sure to get a bunch of negative responses to this but just know that after 32 years of doing Pilates I have very healthy joints and and strong and flexible and have overcome many injuries with Pilates.   I’ve taught thousands of people and helped them find more strength, flexibility and better movement patterns that improved their lives. I’ve helped people heal from both  chronic and acute injuries. I’m not trying to tell anyone who is happy with what they’re doing that they should change.  I’m offering a perspective for the ones who are struggling and want to know how to get better results."
pilates,Allegro vs. Studio Reformer Question,"I had only used Studio reformers and had been considering purchasing an Allegro for a couple reasons (I foster and would be sad if a puppy chewed on a wooden frame, I have to get the frame up a difficult stairway and removable legs would help. Storing it upright would be great. Etc). 

I went to a new studio with Allegros which I was excited to try it person before purchasing. I liked it overall (aside from the footbar), but it definitely felt less smooth and less substantial than the Studio. The ends of the ropes got in my way a couple times somehow which was a minor irritation and if I were the only one using it at home, I’m sure I could solve the rope issue.

I wondered if the different feel (less smooth operation) was just a matter of it being metal, or if the Allegro 2 feels more like the Studio?"

pilates,Cannot get back (roll myself up) from the seal exercise. Do you have any tips or tricks to perfect the roll?,"Hi all! The title explains-I can get into the seal position nice and tight, roll down, but I cannot for the life of me roll back up. I have to keep rolling back and forth on the ground like a kid to create momentum and roll back up but I cannot do the exercise in one go, properly using my core. I just get stuck on the floor, helpless AF :D Any tip for perfecting the roll, or for adjusting the pose. I am tall, 5 11, with most of my weight in my hips/bottom and long legs, so suspecting it's my anatomy + the fact that I am out of shape. I do pilates using pilatesology and I also do yoga. Thanks!"
pilates,How much Pilates should one do,"I hear this question again and again.  There’s no one answer for everyone.  You have to think about what you want out of your practice. In the beginning stages you’re learning both new movements and new ways of moving. This takes consistent practice and repetition. Imagine if you were learning a new language, would one hour per week with no homework or practice in between get you very far? No. For many people only one class a week is like groundhogs day, starting from scratch each time with little to no memory of what was done a week ago. It takes a long time to actually learn like that. And if you want to really change your body only one hour a week is not enough to build new strength and flexibility. If once a week is working for you, great! But if you feel you want more results then you need to do more. Like anything you get back what you put in. A home practice is very beneficial and can even be just 15 minutes of mat work. You’ll only improve in Pilates through practice. You can’t wait until you’re “good at it” to practice.  Practice things you know are appropriate for you but know that these exercises are meant to be a challenge so struggling means your doing it right!  Pain is never good but being confused about things and feeling muscles fatigue is normal. No one got good at these exercises right away. After over 30 years I am still learning and improving because I’m still practicing.  Pilates is a practice"
pilates,3 months of Pilates but I feel like I’m not improving. Is this normal?,"Hello. I started reformer Pilates 3 months ago and I don’t feel like I’ve made any progress. I’m in a beginner class and the instructor always gives options to up weights on springs but I still struggle with the basics (especially arms) and can barely complete the moves. I thought I’d have improved by now, but I’m still struggling. Is it normal for it to take this long to see improvement? I want to be able to do full movements and add more weight but that seems so far fetched now....

For context, I was pretty deconditioned before starting."
pilates,Super Tired after pilate,"I have started going to 1 reformer pilate session/week for 2 weeks now and although I feel great after classes and the back pain from my desk job is gone, I feel super tired the day after pilate. My whole body is sore and I will sleep for 12+ hours. This is tough for me because I have a busy job that requires 50-60 hours/ week. Is there anything I am doing wrong? Will the situation improve on its own? I want to do more sessions per week in the future but now I just feel so tired the day after the session. Thank you before hand for any advice."
pilates,Is it worth it to have a few private sessions to get started?,"Hi everyone, 

I'm interested in learning about Pilates as I think I could benefit a lot from it. I'm not super into exercising, but I'm getting older (25 year old female btw) and realizing it may be time for some more physical activity in my life (besides walking my dogs). I'm at a healthy weight, so I'm not interesting in losing any. I just want to be healthier overall. 

Anyway, if I'm going to start doing Pilates I want to learn it properly. So, my question is- Is it worth paying an instructor for private lessons just to get started? Then after a while, I'll take group classes or branch out on my own? How did you guys get started if you don't mind sharing? Because realistically I can't pay for private sessions long term."

pilates,New vs. older model Balanced Body Studio Reformer,"I am buying a used Balanced Body Studio Reformer.  It seems to be in great condition.  I was going to buy it new from BB, but it would cost more, tax and shipping added, and 8-10 week wait time.  I will be getting my reformer next week.  The only difference I can see on this reformer vs. a new on is that the handles behind the shoulder rests are silver metal, not the black plastic that I normally see.  

Other than that, are Studio Reformers basically the same or have there been any major updates to the design?  I am a beginner and just need something to help me learn from home in addition to the classes I attend.  I just want to make sure I am making the right decision and not purchasing something that is missing some major ""bell/whistle"" that I can't live without.  

Thank you!"

Any advice much appreciated."
pilates,I had to ask an unvaccinated person to move away from me in class,"Small studio with 8 reformers. Instructor discussing her vaccinated family member getting Covid after a wedding. A few of us commiserate on the state of things. Someone mentions A local hospital whose workers were protesting against a vaccine mandate. 

Another regular comes in and takes the machine next to mine. They chime in with, ""they can't require anyone to get an injection."" Someone else says that yes they can, there is precedent. And I mentioned that they've been requiring it in schools for years with measles, mumps, rubella, etc. 

I asked her if she was vaccinated and she said, I had Covid, why would I get vaccinated? I immediately freaked out and almost moved to another machine myself, but decided to ask her to move. When the instructor became aware she asked her to move all the way to the end of the row. There was an empty machine so she was separated from the next person. 

There is a sign on the door saying the CDC recommends masks for those who are unvaccinated. The instructor said she wasn't going to say anything to her about it. 

Overall, I am frustrated that I even had to think about this. She should've been wearing a mask. Now I'm questioning whether I wanna continue going to class regularly. And believe me, I don't want to be having political conversations right before I do Pilates, I am there to unwind and de-stress. 

What do you all think? I guess if this crowd is like any other, half of you will be with me and half of you against. Yay America"

pilates,Balanced Body Revo vs. Classic Spring Bar,"I am planning on buying a Studio Reformer.  Not sure if I will buy it new directly from BB or used.  I recently saw a used reformer that was really nice, but it had the classic spring bar, not the Revo.  Is having the classic spring bar, not the Revo a big deal?  What are the major pros/cons of this?  I have been looking online for comparisons and don't see much.  Of course, the BB site does not really say which is better.  

I will be using this reformer for personal use.  I am a beginner and don't really know classical yet, but I hope to mix up my practice with both classical and contemporary styles.  I may also be using it for more ""fitness"" style pilates in the future.  I want to have the ability to use it for just about anything.

Thanks in advance for any info/opinion you can give."
pilates,The myth of “sculpting”,"A balanced healthy body looks different for everyone. The marketing about “sculpting” your abs or butt or whatever is just misleading.  You can not burn fat from a particular area or make muscles look like an anatomy book necessarily.  Genetics play a huge role in how your body is shaped. Some people won’t get that 6 pack no matter how strong their abs are! Functional strength and flexibility are what’s important. I’ve seen people who looked like fitness models yet were not actually functionally strong and flexible and people who looked very “out of shape” who were incredibly strong, flexible and functional.   I wish more people cared more anyhow their bodies felt and worked instead of fixating on some special look that may not even be achievable in a healthy way.  There is no “Pilates body” to achieve, your body being strong, flexible and functional is what Pilates is truly about."
pilates,Hips jutting between the reformer shoulder rests?,"Title pretty much says it all! Today we had an instructor I’ve never seen/had before filling in for a class, and we were doing some arm work on the reformer. She had us lean our bottom/lower back against the shoulder rests while sitting up, place our hands in the short straps, and do these arm presses. Much to my dismay, my hips are just about the size of the space between the shoulder rests, and I kept jutting inside. It was extremely uncomfortable, and I couldn’t stay sat up. She left as quickly as she came, and I couldn’t ask for a modification for this, and I’m fairly new to reformer Pilates. Would love a suggestion if someone else has experienced this! Thanks!"

I am 22 years old who love wellness and fitness. 
I have been into Pilates for a year and a half . I do love other kind of workouts though I have to do Pilates at least once a week . Where I live it’s very expensive to go to a class etc . I do all my workouts at home following a YouTube video which I do enjoy!!

I will be graduating this year from college. 

I am thinking of taking training course to be a Pilates instructor. Where I live we don’t have places for that and usually who instruct such classes are foreigners . 

Do you think there are programs for that available for people to train abroad ?

Recently, when I did poses on my back, like the bridge or the hundred, I could feel all this pressure on my neck, akin to when you are upside-down. Does that make sense? Except I'm only laying on my back. At first, I chalked it up to living in an old house with wonky, uneven floors - I thought maybe my head was dipping too low, except now I'm noticing it when I perform a move like bird-dog/superman, where I'm on my hands on knees.

pilates,"I did my first Barre and Stretch class today, and I got very ill afterwards.","About 7 weeks ago, give or take, I started participating in Pilates classes 3 times a week (1 reformer, 2 matwork).  I’m very determined to improve my strength, posture, and overall just absorb all the benefits I can from Pilates. I’m also trying to improve my eating habits with a calorie deficit, but I so obviously need to improve my cardiovascular health. 

The Barre class I participated in today was very upbeat and involved a lot of Cardio. The barre youtube videos I used to watch and follow, I realise, didn’t focus a lot on Cardio but rather form, I suppose. About 25-30mins into the class, I start to feel very nauseas and faint and I had the sudden urge to vomit. I swiftly exited the class to go to the bathroom and I was dizzy and my hearing went a bit funny, and overall just felt disgusting (kind of like when you’re drunk and you’ve reached that point when you’re very ill). I had to leave earlier than the 45min stint. It was really unpleasant and I suppose embarrassing, but more than anything, I’m just really disappointed in myself that I couldn’t even stick it out for the whole 45mins. 

I am wondering if anyone has any tips for me on how I can improve and progress so I can eventually endure a full class of Barre Pilates without feeling ill? I am open to any tips and advice on improvement. 

Thank you :)"
pilates,Any extra tall folks have a regular length reformer at home? Looking for recommendations that both a tall and average size person can use.,"So I ordered an Allegro Stretch from Balanced Body and they called to confirm my order and told me that if I was under 6'4"" I would be seriously uncomfortable trying to use it, so I had to cancel it and I'm back at square one. 

My issue is that I'm 5'8"" and my husband is 6'5"". I got the Allegro Stretch so we could both use it. My understanding was that the standing platform could make it a little shorter, but I was wrong.  This is especially annoying because the headline at the top of the Allegro Stretch page says ""Perfect for users over 6'4"" and *anyone* wanting more jumping space for cardio workouts."" Their recommendation was to instead get the Studio reformer with the Revo footbar but (1) they only suggested that that ""may"" work, (2) it is way bigger and heavier and more expensive and we honestly don't need all that unless it is our only option. 

My husband is only one inch taller than what is recommended for the regular Allegro reformer, but they insisted he wouldn't fit on it. We have no studios in my town where he can just go try one out. I have taken privates in the past and would really love to have a reformer at home that we can both use considering how  expensive they are. Is there anyone out there who is over 6'4"" and using regular length reformer at home?

Also, as a general vent...the Balanced Body ""how to choose a reformer videos"" are not helpful. They contain information that can clearly be read on each product listing and lack all specificity. Ugh."

I was able to do most of the workout but then started to feeling sore but I know its definitely from using my core in ways I havent ever used before. I browsed through the rest of her workouts and it looks like the box is incorporated in a majority and looks like most can be modified to just use without the machine. Is this wise? If so, what box is budget friendly? Im thinking range of 100-200 with 200 being the max."

I have two mats currently. One is cheap, made of foam rubber and very thick (1/2""). It's great when I'm kneeling, but my feet are as grounded as I'd like when I'm standing. I'm willing to give up a little comfort for rock solid stability. My other mat is very large - 8' by 8'. I don't mind getting it out and setting it up for a full hour long session, but it's overkill when I just want a quick impromptu workout of 10 to 20 minutes. The second one is also foam but not as thick, so I feel more stable on it.

Price is no object. I consider this an investment in my health. What's your recommendation? I'd be especially happy if I can find one that's stable AND slightly larger than ""standard"" size since I'm big."
pilates,Studio time vs home practice,"Just wondering if there is a generally accepted amount of time that should be spent practicing in a studio with a teacher vs at home.

I really can’t afford more than once per week at a studio due to how pricey classes are here, but I worry I’m not going to be getting benefits if I’m mostly doing mat work at home. 

Eventually, I may look into buying my own Reformer, but that is a long time in the future. 

Wondering how others make it work who can’t get it the studio as often as they’d like."
pilates,Pilates is not “whatever you want it to be”,"I’m a very experienced contemporary Pilates teacher. I do not subscribe to the belief that it’s only certain exercises done in specific order. I’ve seen countless benefits from Pilates for myself and for the hundreds of clients I’ve taught over decades. And I won’t just allow people to think that it can be “whatever you want”. Nope. It’s what it is. People do Pilates for a myriad of reasons but the industry has been feeding people untrue information about “Pilates body” and weight loss magic and it’s just not true.  It can be part of a weight loss program but it isn’t a weight loss method. You don’t need to be a dancer, look like a dancer or even want to look like a dancer to do it.  And it won’t give a different body. It’ll make your body better.  But unless you are dong many other things that lead to weight loss you won’t lose any significant amount of weight with Pilates.  Sorry.  But you don’t need to be thin to do Pilates. Or flexible. Or anything. Pilates is for everyone. But it’s not some magic thing that does  everything just because you want it to.     It’s an amazing system of neuromuscular reeducation which is a technical way of saying it helps your body work and move better. Posture, bone density, balance, coordination, strength, flexibility and on and on will improve with consistent practice.  But weight loss has never been a component of the method and no amount of thin toned people on Instagram and YouTube can make that the truth.   Please do practice Pilates but know what it can and cannot do."
pilates,"Recommendations for Pilates studios in Folsom, CA (near Sacramento)","Hi, I am looking for Pilates studios recommendations in Folsom, CA and surrounding areas near Sacramento. Cross posted from Sacramento forum as people here might be able to help.  Thanks !"
pilates,Pilates is whatever you want it to be.,"Want it to be a weight loss activity? Want to feel the burn? Want to chase after that Pilates body? Want to use it as a place to meet your friends and nothing more than that? Want exercise to be entertainment? Want to use it as a hobby? Want it to help you with functional movement? Want to remember what it feels like to be in a dance class? Want to just try it out to see what it’s like? 

All of these reasons are great reasons to do Pilates. There’s no wrong reason to do Pilates. And there’s no wrong motivation or “mindset” to bring to Pilates. Whether you’re doing a six week Pilates-based body buster boot camp type thing, one you tube class, or have a lifetime of intense training you are doing great. Keep it up! Keep moving and ENJOY it! No one is allowed to tell you the reason you are doing pilates is invalid or wrong or not the point."
pilates,Pilates as spinal health system,"I find it amazing that with all these posts about Pilates no one really seems to promote the fundamental aspects of Pilates, which is spinal health and functional movement.  Toned muscles don’t matter if you do not have functional mechanics.  Damaging your joints to burn more calories isn’t wise. Joseph Pilates was obsessed with the spine and the method is most valuable in its spinal focus. Very few fitness methods even look at spinal health and with it a body will not stay functional with age. Healthy movement is just as important as healthy food. So instead of going for the burn and fixating on timing your arms or ass please think about what Pilates is doing for your spine.  The spine is central to our body and to the Pilates method.  If your spine is strong and flexible you’ll be far better off of in life and as you age. And a workout that makes you look good without considering how your body actually functions isn’t the best plan long term."
pilates,Pilates is not about weight loss.,"Pilates is not nor has it ever been about weight loss.  

Exercise is not really about weight loss either.   Exercise is needed because humans are made to move. Life has changed to being far too sedentary  so exercise is something we need because we don’t get enough movement.  It’s not really about burning calories. Doing aggressive exercises to burn high numbers of calories can really damage your joints in the long term.  Exercise is supposed to get you moving, strengthening and stretching your body hopefully in a balanced way to help you maintain functional movements.  I’m this way Pilates is amazing because it’s designed with how our bodies move, particularly the spine. It’s meant to improve how your joints work. It’s a movement practice that will help you continue being capable and active until you die. It’s not a weight loss method. 

And guess what? None of those so called weight loss methods really work. If they did we’d be a very fit country here in the US.  But we’re not. Because everyone is trying to find some magic easy weight loss trick. The trick is eat a healthy diet, eat an appropriate amount of calories and be as active as you can be. And that’s not a diet or a 30 day challenge.  That’s for life. And being thin doesn’t mean you’re healthy and if you’re doing excessive joint damaging exercises to stay thin you’ll be very sorry someday when your joints no longer work properly without pain. 

There’s no magic weight loss trick.  And Pilates isn’t for or about weight loss. And being thin doesn’t equal being strong or functional or healthy.  Being functional and healthy comes from having a functional and healthy lifestyle. Which a consistent practice of Pilates can definitely help you with."
pilates,Is Pilates just deep stretching w expensive equipment?,I took my first Pilates class today and I was surprised how different it was as a workout class. I like to workout doing new things and for a while I really enjoyed those cycling classes for a while or some occasional dance classes w my coworker. I was surprised how it didn’t really feel like it was actual exercise or is the point to focus more on strength rather than cardio? I’ll most definitely feel it tmr morning because I was literally shaking during it but is that how a normal Pilates class goes. I didn’t expect the 45 minute class to end so much earlier than I thought. I’ll probs give it another try because I also want to tone up my body lolol
pilates,The truth about “Classical” vs “Contemporary” - my research about the Pilates industry,"
How a retired journalist went straight to the dark side of Pilates

During a 14-year journalistic career I learned to be skeptical of whatever I was being told. Every public figure and “expert in the field” that I interviewed had their own version of “the truth”, carefully underlining certain facts while skillfully omitting or downplaying others in order to bolster their narrative. Using politically correct, gimmicky language was another staple. And, of course, every one of them would accuse their opponents of doing exactly what they were doing!

I eventually burned out on journalism and decided to reignite my passion for teaching movement. I figured that getting people’s bodies twisting and turning is much better than spinning yet another news story into their brains. But given my vast experience in doing the latter, I discovered the dark side of Pilates a lot quicker than I found out all the intricacies of the Teaser.

I began my formal education by doing exercises exactly as Joseph Pilates prescribed in his book “Return to Life through Contrology”, then graduated to YouTube videos. Realizing I needed professional coaching, I enrolled into Polestar Pilates.

The instructors explained why Polestar’s so-called “Contemporary” approach is very different from “Classical”. They explained that Polestar founder Brent Anderson broke new ground by incorporating the Moshe Feldenkrais movement method and elements of physical therapy to help beginners.

But as I was learning to move my body in new ways, the old cynical media guy in my mind was signaling that something was off. The biomechanics and movement lessons were very interesting. It was also no surprise that the teachers were towing the company line by pushing various workshops, seminars and Anatomy Trains courses.
 
What caught my attention, however was the way the mentors preached the Polestar methodology as “the only right way” and sold themselves as “innovators” in the world of Pilates, while taking subliminal swipes at the competition from the “classical” school of thought. Experienced fitness trainers were falling for it hook line and sinker, expressing sorrow for “teaching people the wrong way” all these years. I was a rookie exercise instructor but a veteran cynical media guy, so I wasn’t easily fooled. Gimmicky language? Check. Omitting key facts about other schools? Check. Making it sound like there’s only one absolute truth in the world of Pilates? Check!

I signed up for Pilates Anytime to see for myself. The site offered classes from teachers who were supposed to be the best in the industry. All classes were divided into “classical” and “contemporary” categories.

The “classical” guys all did the same 34 exercises, which Joseph Pilates called “Contrology” many decades ago. Some even dared to change up their “original order” and add a few wrinkles, while others taught “archival” classes, doing things “exactly like Joe did” in terms of technique. The only thing missing was the jumpy sped up black and white film to add to the “vintage” feel of a bygone era.

Each “contemporary” Pilates school meanwhile had slightly different variations of the same pre-Pilates exercises I learned at Polestar. So much for the “unique” and “innovative” approach that each of them advertised! I dug deeper into that. After getting my investigative journalist hat back out of the closet despite a career change, I found all the skeletons of the Pilates business there as well.

During our introductory course, Polestar teachers briefly mentioned a lawsuit which cancelled the “Pilates” trademark and made it a generic term for an exercise method, much like “Karate” or “Yoga”.

I found out that after Joseph Pilates died in 1967, none of his teachers wanted to run his failing business. Eventually Romana Kryzanowska agreed to try and keep the studio going. Since she had lived in Peru since 1944, she had no idea about studio operations. During her time she seduced a series of men to assist her; the final one was Sean Gallagher. Since she had fraudulently registered the name Pilates as a trademark circa 1988, she and Sean Gallagher were able to sue at least ten studios/companies and threaten about 100 studio owners with Cease &amp; Desist legal notices.  Of course, Joe himself always called his method “Contrology"".

Eve Gentry— Joe’s first teacher— moved to Santa Fe in 1968 the year after his death. She soon realized that the dancer bodies and the few elite clients at the New York studio were different from the public who didn’t have the flexibility and athleticism to do Contrology. The original repertoire was nearly impossible for typical Americans whose idea of “Corkscrew” was opening up a bottle to go with an extra-large meal, rather than twisting their increasingly obese bodies upside down.
 
Eve Gentry and not Brent Anderson was actually the first to incorporate the Feldenkrais movement method into Pilates, in order to teach clients basic functional movements before tackling the advanced work. A grainy video from October 1991 clearly showed her teaching a workshop organized by The Institute for the Pilates Method. Polestar’s Brent Anderson, BASI Pilates founder Rael Isacowitz and others from major Pilates schools were in attendance. They were learning the same moves I learned at Polestar nearly three decades later. 

No wonder every “contemporary” Pilates school had the same repertoire!

The Institute for the Pilates Method offered the first ever organized Pilates certification program in 1992 which is why Romana and Sean sued them. Plus, they filed a Trademark Cancellation Action in 1993.    Eventually they changed their name to “PhysicalMind Institute” to remove the other “P-word” from its name.

Romana and Gallagher continued bullying others who dared use the “Pilates” name too, until they met their match in Ken Endelman from Balanced Body Inc. The owner of the largest Pilates equipment manufacturer filed a class-action countersuit, and the courts cancelled the trademark on October 20th, 2000. It is extremely rare for the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office to cancel a trademark since the fees support this bureau.
  
The losers of the case immediately branded their Pilates as “classical” and continued teaching the old-school version of the method. Those who attended Eve Gentry’s workshops became known as “contemporary”.

In the name of journalistic integrity, let’s drop the gimmicks and call things by their proper names! “Classical” is nothing more than Pilates by the trademark losers. It teaches a complex routine from the Middle Ages, with enough forward flexion exercises to bend a stone statue in half. Pro athletes, dancers and other impressive physical specimen might be able to do it, but not “the average Joe”.
“The original Joe”, who created this method, was a prolific inventor. If these purists wanted to really “do what Joe did”, they would be inventing new devices and equipment, while always looking to improve the exercises. Thus, “contemporary” Pilates is ironically doing a better job of “preserving Joe’s legacy” of innovation.
 
That’s because “Contemporary” is essentially smart Pilates from Eve Gentry’s lineage. They use a repertoire more appropriate for the always-texting, always-sitting, neck-forward, office-working person of today. It features simple movements and lots of extension, side bending and twisting which their spines don’t get to enjoy otherwise. There is also much needed standing Pilates work and many new “props” and inventions, including from the certification pioneers at Physical Mind Institute.

Nowadays Pilates is big business, and most other schools, including Polestar, adhere to the certification standards of the Pilates Method Alliance (PMA), which was formed shortly after the trademark case. I didn’t even want to think of the type of political games and corporate battles going on in there, but the cynic in me assumed the worst.

I got a taste of it when taking my certification exam with Polestar, however. It seemed like I was taking a college-entry multiple choice SAT test. Standardized trick questions about exercises and anatomy only tested my ability to take the test itself, rather than finding out what I can do thinking on my feet. Not what I was used to, after running through fluid 24/7 live news environments with a million moving parts. I still passed the exam and now I’m ready to continue my Pilates journey with no more illusions as to what the business is all about.

Over these past two years, I went through the magic circle of life: quitting a jaded industry, getting into a new one, only to find the same dark underbelly of politics, spin, and gimmicks, but with a more athletic flavor."

pilates,Created a resource on Male Athletes who do Pilates (still active in their sport today),"Hello everyone,

Hope you all had a great 4th! 

A couple of my friends even asked me recently if Pilates was useful for men (they wanted to get their husbands involved with COVID restrictions being lifted)...

So I was searching for articles to send them on Athletes, specifically male athletes who do Pilates...

And while there were some wonderful resources out there, many of the articles contained athletes who have been retired for many years now.

I know the fitness industry goes through phases, so I wanted to make sure I sent an updated list to my friends. Since I couldn't find an up-to-date resource, I was inspired to create my own!

I ended up creating a post on 25 Male Athletes Who Do Pilates in 2021 (All still active in their respective sport today) as seen below:

[https://pilatesbypamela.com/blog/pro-athletes-pilates/](https://pilatesbypamela.com/blog/pro-athletes-pilates/)

I sent out the article to a few of my friends with the hope that it convinces their husbands to try out at least 1 class lol.

Anyway, I thought I would share this with you all in case you had a friend that needed some additional convincing :). 

I will also make a conscious effort to update the post every 3-6 months to ensure the athletes featured are all still active."
pilates,Feeling sleepy after a routine,"Forgive me if this has been asked before, did a quick search but couldn't find anything similar.

Recently after a routine I've felt like I could just lie on my mat and sleep. It doesn't matter how long the routine is (I'll either do 30 minutes or an hour when I'm feeling brave) afterwards I'm just drained. It might be relevant that I'm restarting my pilates journey after a good 5 years or so recovering from one thing or another but I never had this issue previously. Is this normal for some?"

Thanks!
pilates,Newbie,Hi all. I’ve started taking private reformer lessons twice a week. It’s pretty expensive but I needed one-on-one training to start with to get familiar with the machine and movements. I plan to shift after about 10 lessons to group classes to save money but also want to train at home with mat classes. What home videos would you recommend? All I have is my Mari Winsor video that I dug out from mothballs. It’s great but would love some modern suggestions too. Thanks!
pilates,Pilates body,"There’s no special “Pilates body”.  There are bodies that do Pilates.  

Those long tall lean toned people you see advertising their perfect Pilates bodies got those by genetics.  And often decades of dance training or other sports or fitness training.  Bodies adapt to how we train but this takes years.  And years.  And some more years.  And unless you’re a dancer you don’t need a “dancer’s body”.  

Genetics play a huge part in body make up.  No training can change your structure.  You can improve your body but focusing only on the visible changes is quite disrespectful to what Pilates is truly about… changing your bodies movement patterns and getting to be a more functional human being.  At whatever size you are.  

Far too many people with these “Pilates bodies” are not eating nearly enough calories and over exercising to look like they do.  Of course not all.  But far too many.  And many dancers do this as well.  

If we can shift the focus to having a strong flexible functional body being the most important thing success is so much more achievable.  And that’s much healthier. And isn’t that the point?  

A fit body doesn’t look the same for any two different people.  Stop thinking that the Pilates method will give you a different body.  The body you have is fine. Pilates will make it function better and also look better but looking like a dancer isn’t the point or a realistic goal for most people. 

And thinness is NOT fitness. 

I’ve taught many people who looked very fit but we’re actually not really truly fit and functional and all the excessive exercise and diet they did was deeply damaging them but they looked “fit”.   I’ve also taught people who didn’t look fit at all yet they were indeed very fit, strong and functional.  

Pilates is a movement practice. It will help your body move better. It will help you live life better. It will transform you but many of those changes will not be visible but they will be the most valuable changes.  They’ll be the ones that help you age well. 

And there are some Pilates teachers out there who do not have that so called “Pilates body” and they’re excellent teachers yet people judge them for what they look like and miss out on their amazing teaching skills.  Just because a Pilates teacher is long and lean doesn’t mean they’re a good teacher. A huge part of that body was just genetics.  

Everyone who does Pilates has a Pilates body."
pilates,pilates once a week plus walking?,"Hi everyone! i was doing pilates about once a week from late march til mid may, until I got a new job and had to relocate.

thank you!!"
pilates,Found a pricing loophole for a pilates studio through ClassPass... is this frowned upon?,"I'm really trying to figure out how I can afford to incorporate pilates into my fitness routine. I live in a major city so all of the gym membership and class prices are massively inflated. My regular gym membership is $60 a month and that's literally the cheapest one that you can get here. I was searching around for pilates studios and I found a good one that offers its own packages and is also on ClassPass. Having not yet tried ClassPass, I decided to sign up for a free trial, in order to try out one or two studios before making the decision to subscribe to ClassPass or to buy a package directly.

So the studio that I'm interested in offers a range of packages, with the smallest cheapest one costing more per class, on a graduated scale with the most expensive and expansive one costing the least per class. A package of ten classes bought at the studio costs $254. The ClassPass subscription with enough credits for ten classes at this gym costs $170. 

Would I get called out for booking all of my classes at this studio through ClassPass? Is that frowned upon or is it fair game? Does ClassPass cap how often you can frequent the same class, gym, or studio? Is this a legitimate loophole or am I missing something?"
pilates,How many calories do you usually burn in an hour of Pilates?,"I’ve seen various websites say that the average is around 200 kcal per hour, but for me, it’s always been higher. 

Be sure to say whether you’re doing mat or reformer, if you feel there’s a difference!

I average about 300 calories per hour. Mat and reformer are actually pretty close for me, with reformer edging just past it. I’m a few classes away from hitting 30 classes since I started, so maybe it’ll go down as I get better at it. 

What about you?"
pilates,"How often do you have to go to pilates to develop a ""pilates body""?","I'm really interested in trying pilates but it's SO expensive! I've been going to the gym since I was 16 (I'm 25 now) and over the years I've really learned to tune in to ""the burn"" if you will. I was lucky enough at one point to be able to afford a personal trainer for a few months when I was younger who really taught me about form and what I should be looking for and sensing while I'm doing an exercise. Through that education, I've been able to explore various equipment-free Pilates workouts on youtube and actually understand what to do and what to feel. 

I used to do a lot of HIIT and heavier weight lifting and I did notice how it affected my body composition. More recently I've started using lighter weights, higher reps, and working on slow and controlled movements. Rather than reaching a rep-count, I use a timer instead. I've noticed more definition and length in my arms doing tiny movements with 1lb weights than I ever have with heavier weights. I've also noticed a huge difference in the look of my core through doing various plank exercises like a plank with a ""hip dip"" or a pike, very slowly, intentionally building up the burn and controlling my muscles and movement.

While I can do this sort of thing at my own gym, I really want to incorporate real pilates classes, with instruction and a reformer, into my fitness routine. The only thing is that I definitely cannot afford to go every single day, or even multiple times a week for that matter. It might be just a once-a-week thing for me for a while. My question is, is that really enough to start seeing a change in my body composition? Are there aspects of this type of training that I can take back to the gym with me and continue to progress on my own?"
pilates,Pilates Arc/Spine Corrector?,"I’m quite tempted to get one. My lower back is still sore from doing too many inversions in May, and I have tight hips.

pilates,Will pilates develop core or do I need more core strength to progress in pilates?,"I am relatively new to pilates, I've been going 3-5 times a week for the last month or so. I really enjoy it, but I feel my lack or core strength is holding me back. I'm hot off the heels of two back to back medically complicated pregnancies ending in c-sections, so my core strength is pretty much non existant. I can't even do a sit up. I have to roll into my side to sit up and change the springs. Do you think I'll gain significant core strength from pilates or should I be supplementing? Thanks!"

I’ve been going to club Pilates for a month now. I’ve been going every day and there’s one instructor I’m not a huge fan of. 

I only have his classes once a week when the master instructor is not there. I like going everyday, but I just don’t enjoy his presence and the way he speaks to some of the older members. I don’t enjoy going on the day I have him.

Should I keep going to his classes or skip them? I don’t want to ruin my Pilates goal of  getting stronger…but I also don’t want to dislike a class. Any feedback is appreciated."
pilates,New to Pilates,"Hi there everyone. I am new to Pilates and I have a few questions. So new, in fact, that I actually haven’t taken a class yet haha. But I’m very interested and excited about joining a new studio by my house. I have done lots of calisthenics and yoga classes (I’ve done yoga on and off for the past 10 years) and occasional running and jogging. 

I wanted to know if Pilates can be done exclusively as one’s only form of exercise or if it’s good to switch it up and do cardio i.e. running or swimming/weight training/calisthenics.

How have you noticed a change in your body (muscles, posture, endurance, etc) or mind since you started Pilates? Were there any unexpected changes? I would also like to hear from people about their switch to or from Pilates if they’re coming from other forms of exercise. Thank you!!"
pilates,Workouts focused on exhale?,"Due to some lung damage, I have the issue with air trapping in the lungs which leads to feeling out of breath during any exertion.

I used to lift weights/bodybuilding and swim but can do neither now due to this limitation.

Does Pilates contains activities to force exhale (to push out the trapped air)? (or basically in a position to put pressure on lower part of lungs to mechanically push out the air)

Any idea appreciated!"
pilates,Private Lesson Frequency for a Beginner?,"I'm a beginner with a problematic hip, so I want to start out taking private lessons where I'll get lots of one-on-one attention. I'm also a grad student on a budget, so I'm trying to figure out how frequently I can schedule privates and still see results. Twice a week maybe? Can I get away with once-weekly privates if I supplement with mat work at home? Please be honest!"
pilates,Hip Flexor Cues,"Teachers: What are some of your favorite cues and/or exercises to help your students get out of their hip flexors during a session?

Students: Do you have a favorite cue or exercise that has helped you from over using your hip flexors?  

I’m a teacher who sees a fair amount of clients struggling with hip flexor pain during seated work or legs in tabletop. While there are lots of ways to address these pains— I’m wondering how others teachers/students handle it? Do you add bolsters? How do you discuss the cause of the overactive hip flexors in a way that helps clients improve?"
pilates,Help with overactive adductors!!,"Hi pilates people. I've been doing pilates again since March 2021. A few weeks ago I did a mat class and reformer class that really worked my adductors. The problem is ever since then they seem to activate really easily. When ever I sit they just switch on and I have to ""man spread"" to stretch out the area to switch them off. Any advice of what I can do to get them back to normal?"
pilates,Can I train everyday,"I want to get better at pilates, have been training 3x per week. I feel like I could do more, what do you all think."
pilates,How our muscles work,"There’s a lot of confusion about abdominal engagement.  People who say that you must clench your abs to protect your spine just do not have a true understanding of how muscles and movement works. Pilates is so beneficial in part because it focuses on how to connect the deeper abdominal muscles to support, stabilize and move the spine. But to connect those deep muscles “clenching” isn’t the way.  Clenching creates a braced tight spine which isn’t conducive to healthy movements.  The subtle nuances of Pilates are best learned by a skilled experienced teacher.  If you’ve been having trouble learning his with a video that’s because the Pilates method was never intended to be taught that way. A person needs cues and feedback only a live teacher can give. But if you’re seeking advice please always consider that an actual Pilates teacher will have a deep understanding of how both Pilates and the body works, as well as what cues actually work.  Moving with both support and efficiency are the goal, not clenching or hinge tight and then trying to execute flowing movements."
pilates,How to do core workouts the correct way?,"I’m having a difficult time understanding reclined core workouts specifically (leg lifts, crunches, etc). I hear people say not to push the belly out all the time, but I’m not sure how to know when/if I’m doing that. As our bodies fold, our bellies naturally push out, right? Like when we sit, we compress our core and our bellies look like they have rolls. I’ve tried watching others do it online, but either their yoga pants have a lot of compression, or their bellies don’t push up like mine. 

I would like to make sure im not causing more harm by doing it incorrectly, but I can’t find any guides that explain it better online. 

Any tips, cues, advice is appreciated!!"
pilates,Are online classes worth it?," I'm skeptical. Need to take an extra credit for school and pilates is an option, but I feel like I won't get nearly as much benefit from it just following along on my computer in my living room. I've taken an in person class before and struggled with form the whole time even there. Anyone have experience with online classes? Thoughts?"
pilates,Roll up problem post hysterectomy.,"I have been doing Pilates on and off for years. I used to be able to do roll ups without too much of an issue. 

Then I had a hysterectomy, which was rather messy, and I ended up with a t-surgery which basically means you have both vertical and horizontal abdominal cuts. I was a while post surgery with no Pilates at all and then slowly built back up again with a studio instructor and am now doing 2 Zoom classes a week.

I still can't do roll ups and I don't know it if is because I am just not trying hard enough / putting in enough effort over a prolonged period of time (in which case I just need to keep trying) or if the nature of the surgery means that I won't (or shouldn't) do them again.

If it is just that I need to work through it, any tips?

Thanks"

pilates,My muscles are weaker?,"Hi everyone! Because of the pandemic I stopped going to my pilates reformer classes for around 8 months last year. During the summer I started again and then had to stop because the cases started to grow (I had covid during that time and I never felt that weak before). In the meantime I moved so I was about two months without going to my classes, again. I tried to move, but I don't have weights in my house. So two weeks ago I started in another studio and Jesus my arms are not strong! I have no problems when it comes to abs or leg work, but I can't do any arm work. Maybe the new instructor doesn't know yet how much I can lift, but what if that time away of pilates made me weaker? Has any of you had covid and experienced something similar? Note that I can do planks and I can even do headstands, bur the problem is when we work with the strips (I guess this is the name in English? Lol)"

pilates,Is it time to break up with your Pilates Instructor?,"# How to break up with your Pilates Instructor...

Here's the deal. Pilates can get personal really fast. It's easy to develop a relationship with your instructor! But that doesn't mean you are stuck with them for life. Know when it's time to end your Pilates relationship. 

**1. Look for the warning signs....** 

* Your needs/concerns aren't being addressed.  
* Your instructor is putting you through what they want to put you through, not what you are comfortable with.  
* Your instructor spends half the session unloading their personal life/problems onto you.   
* Your instructor is showing they don't value showing up to your sessions (constantly cancelling/late/rushed/not mentally present).  
* Yourinstructor starts getting controlling about how you live your life outside of the studio.... (what to eat or not eat, whether or not you should do cardio or lift weights etc.)  
* Your instructor uses scare tactics against other forms of movement (that they conveniently don't teach).   (Ex. everyone that does crossfire get hurts... oh you're going on a run? Don't hurt yourself, go on a walk instead. Oh you're going to yoga tomorrow? Remember what we talked about and don't do any extension, or maybe just don't go.)

**2. Address the elephant in the room!**

**You do not need to feel guilty for wanting a high quality service that you are paying for and invested in!** Voice your concerns. I suggest after a session, to give your instructor time to make a plan to change for the next session. 

Set boundaries for instructors that you love doing Pilates with, but that may be starting to become controlling of your time outside of the studio. 

Let them know you love working with them and the service that they offer.

Also let them know that you are not available to talk about other lifestyle choices during your sessions.  

**3. Seek out new movement professionals that can truly support you on your movement journey.**

If your instructor still doesn't make changes to align with what you value/want out of your experience, it may be time to amicably part ways. Let them know you so appreciate their time, energy, and all of your sessions together but that you are going to make a change to a better fit for you at this point in your life. If you like them and know people that you think would be a good for them, offer to send referrals their way! 

## How not to break up with your instructor...

**-Ghost them....**

This gives them literally zero feedback on your experience, what happened, or maybe areas they could grow in as an instructor. They will assume you got busy, found another studio, maybe don't want to do pilates anymore, wonder where you went or what they did, and they will eventually stop thinking about your sessions you haven't booked altogether. No one wins here. 

**-Show up to your sessions late or with a bad attitude...**

You're instructor is not able to read your mind and this is not only a waste of both your time, but you are literally paying for a bad experience, and possible setting you and your instructor up for an awful day. They might feel the tension but have no idea you feel it's because of them.

**-Blast them on social media/leave angry reviews...**

This does not give them the opportunity to hear you out at all, and definitely not a chance to make a change. If your issues could have been resolved, that chance is likely gone after personally attacking a (probably small) business.  Just because your experience doesn't live up to your expectations doesn't mean that person is an awful instructor or not a good fit for someone else. Save reviews for those really truly awful experiences you want others to be wary of, like if they take your money but never allow you to book a session. Not if you don't like their teaching style. (Sidenote: I also encourage everyone to sit down and write 5 awesome reviews for places that you frequent often. This means the world to a small business owner!)

**Recap...**

90% of Pilates is communication. Instructors communicating with clients, clients communicating with instructors, you communicating with your own body etc. Just like in any relationship, there are going to be some communication breakdowns. Address them right away to keep yourself in a healthy and happy Pilates relationship!

pilates,Just signed up for Club Pilates,"I had my free intro class last night...and I am now super sore! That was just the 30 minute into to all things reformer Pilates too. I’ve been doing mat Pilates on YouTube and this is my first time trying it on the reformer. I can’t imagine how tough even the level 1 classes will be! But I’m so excited. I can’t wait to progress more. I know it’s not classical Pilates but it’s perfect for me. I like how they do have a barre class too since I used to be a Pure Barre member.

I did get a little light headed though between standing up and lying down on the reformer, that kinda concerns me but I think it was also because I didn’t eat much before class and it was my first time trying this. The lady who signed me up said she did have that issue too when she first tried CP a while ago."
pilates,"This might be a dumb question but, how much pilates is considered “too much”?","I recently started pilates (approaching my 30th class) and I absolutely love it. From the discipline to the changes I feel/see. My current membership is for 8 classes, so I’ve been doing about 2 classes a week. I’m interested in upgrading to the “unlimited” membership but it recommendable to practice pilates every day if not almost every day?"
pilates,Is doing pilates two times a week good for a beginner?,"Hello! I’m thinking about going to a pilates class two times a week. I have never done pilates or yoga before and I don’t workout either, I’m “skinny fat” and have little (almost 0) flexibility. 

I’m very interested in doing pilates because I also have bad posture. I was wondering if I could see results (mostly in my posture) just by doing it two times a week."
pilates,Would pilates be enough for a “skinny fat” body?,"My first goal in working out is fixing my posture, and just my overall mood. My second goal is for some aesthetic changes to have some muscle, and get rid of the appearance of being “skinny fat”. 

I often see lifting heavy as the only way to get rid of it, but honestly I hate it. Feels way too stressful, and overwhelming. I prefer how calm pilates feels to me so the idea of being able to have some aesthetic changes while doing a workout I actually like sounds amazing to me."

pilates,help/advice w schedule,"hi! i’ve never posted in here before but i’m looking for some guidance about a potential workout schedule i’m putting together for myself.
this is what i’m thinking:

MWF-Pilates
T TH- strength/hiit
30 min treadmill walk x5 days

so my question is how/what days do I focus a specific muscle group on. Is that a thing with Pilates? should I just do a “full body” pilates on MWF and do lower/upper body on my strength days (T TH) ?
or switch them up and do full body with my strength training days and specific muscle groups on my pilates days?

i’m sorry I hope this makes sense of what I am asking! Thank you in advance!!"
pilates,Friendly reminder about how training your body works,"I know it’s maybe not what you want to hear but it’s the truth… “spot toning” does not work! You can strengthen your muscles in specific ways through exercises but you can not make your body lose fat in a specific area through training.  “Leg sculpt workout” or “burn off belly fat for summer abs” are popular marketing things but they are false advertising.  Genetics play a huge part in how our bodies look.  Every person’s body will put fat where it will, and lose fat from where it will due to genetics, not targeted “fat burning” or “sculpting” exercise.  Some people can do tons of abs and be thin but never get that 6 pack look. Or work on their arms and still not achieve that “cut” tricep look. It’s genetics.  Our bodies are unique and the Pilates method that trains to develop healthy functional movement is going to be effective for most people but the mythological “Pilates body” isn’t a realistic goal for many. And even some who have that “ideal” body look may not actually be healthy and have functional movement patterns.   I wish that functional fitness and longevity were more appealing to the masses. 

While I have been blessed with a pretty good genetic hand I did a lot of damage to my joints and spine in my youth with gymnastics and dance.  I do not regret it but it’s made my lifelong Pilates journey about healing my joints and spine and working to maintain functional fitness and hopefully longevity in my aging process.  I’m approaching 50 and I am still pretty agile despite arthritis coming on. Pilates is truly about giving you a practice to keep you moving for life.  Don’t get caught up with “summer ab” challenges or such nonsense.  You use your body all year. And if you want to have full use of it for life look at a sustainable practice that you can actually maintain all year, year after year, for life.  Just like with fad diets these fast results workout challenges really don’t work. It’s the more boring but effective moderate and consistent choices we make that lead to being truly healthy and functional."

pilates,Help with wandering foot in bridges,"Hi, I am hoping for some advice with home practice. I have an IQ reformer at home and noticed my proprioception has gotten a little wonky after a year+ of self-teaching only. I have been using a mirror more but I also put “parallel feet” markers on my foot bar with some painters tape to help. Since then I’ve noticed my right foot likes to wander further to the right — especially in bridging. Even when I swear I’ve kept my feet still, left is still on its mark but right wiggled over!

Any thoughts what I’m compensating for? I went to a studio for a couple of years but neither of my local options survived lockdown, so I don’t have anyone to spot me in person any more :(

Thanks!"
pilates,Advice for building wrist strength? Pilates newbie,"I’m new to Pilates, and after a couple reformer classes loving it! But sometimes towards the end of class my wrists start feeling a lot of pressure for certain moves esp, plank position/push ups.

pilates,Looking for a Weekly or Bi-weekly video course,"I have been diagnosed with an embedded muscle spasm by my physiotherapist, who have I seen for 11 sessions now and it's still giving problems. They told me to take up pilates which will help with the spasm and all the referred pain it is giving me throughout my entire body every day. I've looked at the wiki (and bookmarked it), giving the first video of each playlist a look, they stop a lot and talk to explain, which is good and I will be reviewing each of them in detail, but I was wondering if there were any good courses of like 7 or 14-day routines I can follow along in time as they do it on the video. So as they start, I start, holding for as long as they hold and ending when they end the video. This will help me keep time and not dawdle in between poses. Thank you all for your time reading this. Hopefully such a series of various levels exist so I can start at beginner and improve."
pilates,Yogini who added Pilates...,"Hi all - I just wanted to share my journey with Pilates with you because I'm so thrilled with how I feel.   I've been a group fitness instructor for about 12 years, and I'm in my early 40s now.    I taught Les Mills programs and did Yoga teacher training in 2013.     Back in 2015-16, I was taking weekly semi-private Reformer classes as a ""thing"" I did for myself and I loved it.   Career changes forced me to give up most of my teaching and weekly Pilates, but I kept teaching weekend yoga classes.    I dabbled in Crossfit in 2019 for about 6 months, but it wasn't for me.    Pandemic hit, and I taught online classes (mainly to keep my class community together - I teach at a gym, not a studio).    When the world started to open again, I wanted to do something for myself that was not yoga.   I researched and found that I had several highly-rated Club Pilates locations near me.   I did the Intro class and fell in love with this discipline all over again.   I've been a member since mid-March and will complete my 55th class tomorrow!   I feel strong, balanced, and lifted!   Best decision I made this past year for sure.   I know CP can vary in quality but I am fortunate to have excellent quality instructors at my studios."
pilates,New to pilates and have back pain and chest pain after class,"Hi everyone.

I haven't been working out for a long time and have been troubled by neck &amp;  shoulder pain for over 2 yrs. My friend suggested I try pilates out and so I contacted an experienced pilates instructor for an 1-1 in-person class.

I felt great right after the session but the next day (which is today), I waked up with tremendous chest pain, and then the chest pain changed to be upper back pain. It has got a lot better now but it's still there. And I feel like it's a bone-related pain rather than muscle.

I contacted her and she said that it's probably because I haven't been working out for a yr or so and we mainly focused our exercise on the chest and upper back areas yeasterday.

But I still feel like it might be a good idea to post my situation here to see whether it is normal./ Should I go to the hospital to get checked out instead? Or what should I pay attention to avoid these pains in future sessions? Any tip would be helpful! Thanks a lot!"
pilates,Learning takes time,"I’m seeing so many posts about people who are just starting Pilates and are worried about “doing it right” to the point of seeming to be scared about it. 


Think about how long it takes a baby to learn to walk, and how no one is worried about their form. They’re figuring it out through practice.  Of course with Pilates we have the benefit of a teacher guiding us but don’t let me bout about improving your form make your feel that you’re not doing it “right”.  It’s a practice.  No one has “perfect form” and the persistence of practice is the only way to learn and improve.  

If you’ve got a serious injury that requires real expertise that’s one thing, but if you’re just starting Pilates to move and strengthen your body please be patient and persistent in your practice.  Let your body move and breathe and allow corrections to be gentle and don’t force yourself to try to do everything perfect and get stressed out. Pilates should relieve stress!   

I’ve been teaching for a long time and I’ve gotten better about seeing how much correction is beneficial and when it’s to a students detriment.  Even teachers are learning all the time.  If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the cues you can try a new teacher, tune them out enough to be free to practice without stress or even talk to the teacher after the class and say that too many corrections are making it difficult for you to feel good about your practice.  I have had times in teaching where I realized that my “helpful corrections” were causing more harm than good and I adapted my approach and I’ve become better and better at teaching, over time.  Just like you will become better and better at doing Pilates, over time.  Allow yourself time to learn and let improvement be a process."
pilates,New to pilates and uncertain about group classes,"Hello! I am new to pilates and just tried an introductory private class yesterday with the reformer. It went pretty well but I definitely needed the instructor’s guidance on certain leg movements and keeping my shoulders relaxed.

I was able to get an introductory student deal (1 private + 5 group classes) for a pretty good rate. Private classes are ideal but also a bit above my budget. 

I signed up for a group mat class and two reformer classes (6 people max), but I’m a little worried about my lack of experience. I feel like I would get lost or do some exercises incorrectly. I have a hunched upper back and tight, rounded shoulders as well as very little core strength, so my goal is to really improve my posture and build core strength. 

I’m not a complete beginner to exercise, but definitely to pilates. I did ashtanga yoga once a week for about three years (but that was almost 2 years ago) and I run 2-3 times a week. I just starting teaching high school and was busy with my Masters so I wasn’t able to exercise frequently for a while… just started up again now that I have more free time.

Thoughts? Should I maybe take a few more private classes before delving into small group? The instructor I had a private lesson with seems to be very attentive to her group classes and usually walks over to a client to correct their posture. Not sure about others."
pilates,Longevity over quick results,"I’ve been doing and teaching Pilates a long time and one trend that makes me sad is the one about “quick results”. Firstly… it’s a lie.  You can not change your body quickly.  The nature of flesh and blood is that while our bodies are indeed malleable nothing changes overnight. And pushing hard for fast change really defeats one of the most beautiful benefits that Pilates can actually deliver, Longevity. A spine and joints that will function as you age are far more valuable than a tight ass tomorrow ever will be. 

So, my advice that maybe no one wants is… slow down. Be consistent.  Work in a way that makes you feel good in your body and let the visible changes that may come be a byproduct of the work, not the focus of it.  Men do Pilates too but I see way too many women who do Pilates are fixated on the looks part and it’s good to remember that our looks are not who we are and having a body that feels good, functions well and will carry us into old age is really what Pilates is about. And it’s a joy to move, breathe and expand our physical potential regardless of what size or how toned we might be."

pilates,Struggling with lower back strain,So I’ve been doing Pilates for about 2 months now and I’m ok with the super beginner stuff but as soon as I try to do anything that involves being on my back and having legs up (tabletop etc) it just seems to put loads of pressure on my lower back. I haven’t used my core all my life it seems and is it just that I need to stick to super beginner stuff for now as my core is too weak to hold my legs? Any suggestions for excercises to build some kind of lower ab strength?
pilates,Beginner questions,"Hi all! I started Pilates about a month and a half back and have been having one reformer class with personal trainer (1-1) per week, and 2 mat classes a week. 

I am really slow at learning physical stuff and it takes me a long time to figure out form. I have purchased some stuff to help me try working on Pilates stuff at home with better form— magic circle and Gaiam Pilates bar, as well as Muscle and Motion subscriptions to better understand my body.

Since starting, I’ve noticed a few things I have questions about:

1. My first few classes I broke a sweat. Now I do not always break a sweat. It’s become harder to go to the end of an exercise too; eg I pretty much collapse halfway through hundreds and the teaser on mat feels so daunting. Is this normal? Am I not working hard enough? Should I be pushing myself during sessions more? Should I be doing some other non-Pilates exercise to improve my stamina? 

2. Injuries— I feel like my body is just so odd. My 1-1 teacher said something about hyper extension in my elbows so I need to be in an almost tshape with my arms for most mat exercises to activate and gain stability from my arm muscles. My left knee is also permanently slightly bent (I tore this ligament as a child) and I need to work on straightening it out as it leads to poor form on exercises (my knee crosses over the other instead of staying parallel to it). I also feel in exercises like it’s very hard for me to find and use the large shoulder muscle that everyone keeps talking about and that I keep getting ending up on my neck. I cannot tell if these types of “body peculiarities” make me a bad fit for Pilates or if time will work this stuff out. Does anyone with experience with these types of issues have any advice/stories to share? 

3. Any others who are very slow at learning physical things/form have tips to share on what I can do by myself to maximize my class time?

Thanks in advance!"
pilates,Would taking a few private lessons be worth it for a super-beginner?,"Hi all! the first (and only) time I took a pilates class the environment wasn't great: it was just me and a few more experienced students, all of whom seemed annoyed with me for being there.

I'm now realizing that I need to do more than just running to stay healthy, and want to hop back on the pilates train. The studio up the street from me offered 3 private lessons for $200, which is a lot, but I'm hoping will give me the foundation I need to continue on my own. As someone with absolutely no core strength or experience, do you think private lessons are worth it to get started?"
pilates,My first pilates class...,"I just did my first mat pilates class. I really liked it and felt like I got a good workout, but I felt a little embarrassed.

 The instructor was very welcoming and positive, but I was the only one sweating. I mean I was sweating buckets.  I couldn't do all of the ab work. I had massive sweat stains on the belly of my leggings.  Everyone else seemed to have dry foreheads while I had to keep stopping to wipe the seat from my face and dripping off my bangs. I was the heaviest one in the class...I am not obese in the least, but about 15 pounds overweight.  I do yoga in occassion and feel I'm pretty good so i was not expecting to be this blindsided by pilates.

pilates,How come the results from pilates/yoga seem so much greater than hard/HIIT workouts?,"Excuse my ignorance!

I am transitioning from a very heavy crossfit/HIIT background to more gentle workouts like yoga/pilates because (no surprise) those hard workouts have been messing up my joints and causing more problems than benefits as of late.

But I'm just incredibly intrigued by the results I've seen of people doing workouts like MWH that seem so gentle (of course, because I'm viewing them from my background) but the bodies and results you see with these workouts seems GREATER than the ones I've witnessed in gyms of people killing themselves.

Anyone know the science/logic behind it? I've been looking for it but can't find much that justifies my observation so makes me think I'm wrong.

(Maybe something with HIIT increases cortisol and LISS lowers it? Or perhaps the mindfulness aspect makes you more aware of your hunger/fullness cues in a way? etc.)

Has anyone else had the experience at the start of barely being able to control your posture and muscles? I kept forgetting one thing or the other, like tightening my core or keeping my shoulders down or opening up my chest, or just having a difficult time getting the motion done correctly on the reformer. Which means the instructor is constantly having to say, ""Remember to do X, no no, do \*this\* not \*that\* .""

I'd like to keep going, but if I am so out of shape that I'm going to do nothing to help me and annoy the instructor, then I'd rather figure out how to get to a baseline on my own. I just don't know what's normal and I am severely out of shape / haven't exercised in years."
pilates,Jail pilates,"I hear pilates was created in jail.

I've been locked in my bedroom most of the time all year. My body hurts and there's no space to walk around even, my own clutter has reduced my space to that of a cell.

Any recommendations on somewhere to start?

pilates,Butt building,21 F 5’2 petite frame 118 lbs. is it possible to build a cute butt by doing Pilates? I don’t want like a huge butt but I’d like a little muscle with the little fat I have back there. Any hope for me?
pilates,I'm new to pilates! Any tips on YouTubers / Apps / websites etc. and what / who to avoid?,"I've been hearing a lot about pilates and am itching to try it out. As I don't feel comfortable going to a class (yet) die to covid I would love to try some stuff at home. I've heard about a few apps before but I would like to try out a few classes / videos before getting into a payment plan.
YouTube videos for exercise always leave me sceptical as I honestly feel like they might as well be ab workouts? (I guess I just don't know what to look for exactly).
Any stuff I should avoid / wait for until I can get classes in person or until I'm more advanced?

Thank you!"
pilates,Pilates reformer cabinet?,"Have seen these on the internet - seems to be a reformer storage cabinet that used to be made by Teague Pilates. Don’t seem to be made anymore.

pilates,What’s your least favorite exercise that you know is the best one for you?,"I’m curious to know if other teachers and practitioners have a least favorite exercise that they know is really the one they need the most?   

For me I used to do less swan and upper back extension because my upper back was so tight and needed more flexion but when I started doing swan and swimming and other extensions more my back felt better and I realized that while it didn’t give immediate relief it gave the most lasting benefits.   Now I’m working on revisiting another one I’m not so excited about, the stomach massage... not sure what it’s going to show me but I think the ones we like the least often teach us the most"
pilates,Using Return to Life for solo practice,"When you are practicing pilates on your own, do you do the entire sequence from Return to Life? Should you go in the same order? How many times do you do each move?"
pilates,Transitions using least amount of equipment,"I’m in teacher training and for flow we are taught to use mindful transitions so the class isn’t constantly shifting from one piece of equipment to the other and to do all exercises on the same equipment we planned 
I’m working on a flow with chair and TRX but am trying to figure out how to best transition from the 2
Footwork on chair, and I was planning on doing legs there too (step ups etc) but wanted to try bridging on TRX 
Any advice would be great, thanks!"
pilates,Pilates and muscles,"There is a LOT of misunderstanding about how muscles and movement work in the Pilates world. I’m seeing it often here and want to offer my advice which is based on anatomy and biomechanics. 

You should not “tighten” your abs. Or your pull down your lats. Or squeeze your glutes. That’s not how movement works. Muscles create movement and the movements in Pilates are designed to engage the muscles in a healthy balanced way. We all need guidance to connect certain underused muscles but that’s what teachers are for.  And telling you to “tighten” your abs or “pull down your lats” when you’re laying on the reformer and pushing your legs straight is insane. You are laying down!  Why do you need the lats to pull down? The lats pull your arms down to your sides, if the arms are already at your sides and you are laying down what reason to they have to do anything? How will tightening your abdominal muscles help your knees straighten?  All these cues will do is create a lot of excess tension in the body and possibly impinge joints.  That’s not healthy movement. The muscles get stronger through the repetition of movement, not from squeezing them tight and then trying to move and breathe fluidly.

 Isometric exercises where you do practice tightening up specific muscles can be great, but that’s not part of Pilates.  

The system of Pilates was never meant to be so fixed on the abdominals.  It’s a full body system. And the abdominal work is wonderful because it moves the spine, and movement can’t happen when you’re tightening up. Tension is not strength.  Squeezing your body and then trying to move isn’t how it works.  Feeling a burn isn’t the goal. If you let your body move the muscles will do their jobs and they get stronger  over time.  Being tight doesn’t mean you’re working harder. It means you’re tense and all that tension will not make you get stronger but it might really harm your joints over time.  Pilates is meant to be done with efficiency and using the least amount of strength required, which creates fluid movement.  So unclench yourself and just move! Your spine will thank you!"

pilates,"Pilates Bridge on the reformer, harder when tall?","I’ve started reformer Pilates classes again after over a year off. Something I’ve always wondered is, that when I do a bridge in the reformer I really struggle to keep the carriage in. It feels like once I like my hips up unless I tense my calves/hamstrings to the point of burning the table needs to move out to accommodate. Tensing my legs this hard makes it impossible to focus articulating my spine. 
This could just be my weak muscles,  but I’m a 6’ tall woman with a long torso, and the foot bar/table is set in the same position as my 5’2” classmates. My instructor said I’m not struggling because I’m tall (which could be true) but just wanted a second opinion."
pilates,Spine Pain?,"Hi everyone! I’ve been practicing Pilates since October of 2020 using Pilatesology videos. I love it!

My issue is that I’ve been having this pinchy pain on what feels like my middle spine. It’s not excruciating, but it’s uncomfortable. It hurts worse when I do any forward bends or corkscrew. It also bothers me somewhat during the seal, but side twists do not bother it. 

Has anyone had this issue, or know what it may be? Thanks so much!"

pilates,“Reformer” Pilates,"People are often saying “reformer Pilates” here.   That’s not a thing.  Pilates is a complete system that encompasses all the work, mat, reformer, trapeze table/cadillac, chair, and ladder barrel.   There are some small apparatus like the foot corrector and small barrel. There’s no “reformer” Pilates that’s something inherently different than the Pilates done on the mat.  Pilates is the method, the machines that are used don’t make it a different or special kind of Pilates.  It’s just Pilates.  On the reformer."
pilates,Exercise is not entertainment,"I’m a Pilates teacher and I of course strive to make my sessions and classes enjoyable for my students.  But.  I’m finding a new trend of some people expecting it to be a form of entertainment and always “fun” and “new” and “not repetitive”.   This is not how training the body or mind works.  

I first did Pilates as rehab for a major knee surgery in 1989. It was wonderful and balanced out my traditional physical therapy. In PT we just focused on my knee, but my Pilates sessions allowed me to use the rest of my body to much fuller extent than I could normally because of the ingenious equipment.  I was a teenager and a gymnast and was quite capable of advanced exercises but we did a balance of challenging exercises and fundamentals because while I was young and strong and flexible I was new to Pilates.  I kept practicing Pilates in college where we had an equipment studio and there I continued practicing what I knew because it was excellent conditioning for my dance training.  In my certification I of course learned all the exercises but in observation of my teacher with her students I saw that the average person isn’t doing super advanced exercises and the fundamentals are truly the core of the work for everyone.  

Now Pilates has gotten pretty tainted by the fitness world. People want it to be a magic cardio weight loss body changing class with instant results.  It’s not.  Nothing is.  Focusing on the “burn” or how sore you are or how many new fancy exercises you can do every class is so outside the point of this deeply intelligent practice.  Practice requires repetition and focus.  If you think those basic fundamentals are easy you are not doing them right.  Every single time I do a basic bridge on the mat or the simple footwork on the reformer I am learning something new about my body and the movement. Sometimes I focus on form, sometimes on my breathing and sometimes I tune into microscopic details of alignment but the work is never boring because it’s a way to tune into my body. The core principles are focus, concentration, breath, centering, flow and precision. If you’re truly engaged with these you’re not bored because you’re engaging with your body and the work.  Looking for a fun entertaining time in Pilates means you’ve pretty much missed the whole point.  It’s basically a movement meditation hybrid. No one meditates for fun!  Of course it can be fun sometimes but it’s actually meant to be work.  And practice.  And it’s not ever truly “easy” if you are doing the work as a practice."
pilates,Repetitive pilates classes,"I’ve been going to pilates for a handful of months now. I started with a bundle of private lessons. Here I noticed a change In my physique within 4 weeks. I switched to group classes. The group classes were exactly the same as the private lessons. I realized I wasn’t getting too much of a difference in personal attention in my private lessons, than I was in group classes though. Maybe here and there in my private classes if I said something was cramping, but other than that, no extra pointers. So it’s going on the 4th month now and I am getting so bored out of my mind. The classes are pretty much the exact same every. Single. Time. The difference  might be that we’ll *sometimes* learn one new move, and maybe never even try that ever again, and by the next class, it’s the same old regimen. I go multiple times a week. I don’t even feel sore after as if my muscles are gaining any extra strength. I noticed I am pretty much at a plateau. I have not seen a difference in my toning, my stomach is not making a difference as far as becoming flatter or stronger. I’m getting really tired and feel like my wheels are spinning and I’m not getting anywhere with this anymore. I’m thinking about going to a different studio or maybe trying something entirely different all together. I’ve been trying to look online to see if this is normal to sign up for classes, and they are the exact. Same. Every. Single. Time. I’m just getting more frustrated than anything. Feels like a waste of time and money. It’s not enjoyable at this point."
pilates,Club Pilates instructors / training advice,"Can any Club Pilates instructors share their experiences with the training, the company and hourly pay?

pilates,No Equipment Pilates YouTube Recommendations? Boho Beautiful and Moving Mango Reviews?,"Is no equipment pilates an actual style of pilates, or is it actually just power yoga / bodyweight workouts? Any recommendations for YouTube channels with free full-length videos of legitimate no equipment pilates with calm voiceovers? I've been doing Boho Beautiful and Moving Mango's videos, as I understand that Blogilates isn't really trustworthy plus I find her voiceovers overly chatty and unhelpful.

For reference - I have been doing cardio and strength workouts with bodyweight, light dumbbells, and resistance bands for about 2 years, using videos by Chloe Ting, Sydney Cummings, Heather Robertson, and Caroline Girvan. I have also been doing yoga for about 2 years, using videos by Yoga With Kassandra, Fightmaster Yoga, and Boho Beautiful. I occasionally do other physical activities like hiking or spin classes. However, I recently fractured by toe and did a quadruple wisdom teeth extraction surgery. Moreover, my country has gone into lockdown mode again. So I'm looking at doing low-impact mat workouts to stay active and strengthen my body, and hopefully also following instructors who serve as role models that focus on body neutrality / positivity. My height is 163cm and my weight is 50kg, and have been a vegan for 1.5 years eating 1500-1800 calories a day. I struggle a bit with diet culture and disordered eating thoughts."

I cant tell if it's the setting/ franchise or if it's just the industry in general. Social media and influencers display ""quick fixes"" and I feel like people shy away from traditional pilates because its ""boring"".  

Other CP instructors feel this way or is this a similar feeling across the board at any studio?"

He gave me some exercises to work with it the other day and it went just fine, but another instructor told my sister that I shouldn’t be doing it because I still have the plate and screws inside my ankle.

I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask, but does anyone know if it’s okay for me to workout on the power plate machine?

This is the machine in question.

pilates,Pregnancy friendly pilates videos/subs.,"Hello! 

I currently subscribe to Melissa Wood Health. I've been doing her videos for the last 3 months or so and really love it. It's helped me lose 12 pounds and feel so much stronger! I am currently pregnant and would love to keep up with pilates workouts through the 3rd trimester. I plan on continuing MWH through at least the end of the 1st trimester. MWH has some prenatal videos, but honestly not that many.

I'm looking for other MWH-like subs. I love following her weekly program and casting to my TV and being able to do workouts in my living room at my own time.

I found The Pilates Class by Jacqui Kingswell via trying to Google this topic. Though I am not sure how many pregnancy friendly videos are actually in her library.

Ideally, I'd like to sub to someone who filmed a program while pregnant! I'd love to hear your recommendations/reviews.

pilates,"12"" Magic Circles?","My social media has had a lot of posts for a new circle. When I checked it out I was stunned that it was $100!

Looking at the Balanced Body site, their 12"" circle is roughly $30. Much better price. When I Googled more options the prices and reviews varied widely!

Does anyone have a 12"" circle that they think is a good value, has comfortable pads, and has a good resistance level?

My 15"" circle is one I picked up years ago at Marshall's. Price was good, resistance is good. My only real complaint about it is that the handle/padded area has an angle/curve and lack of padding that causes discomfort, especially when above the knee.

Thanks in advance!"
pilates,Can a man do pilates?,"Is it social acceptable for man to do pilates? My gym offers Pilates classes, and IV looked in and it's always only women. I have a bad back and research suggests that pilates is really good for back issues. So I'd like to do it but am worried I'll annoy all the ladies if I join their class."
pilates,"Pilates is a practice, not a performance","After over 30 years spent doing Pilates I often barely recognize it as it’s presented to the general public now.  “Sculpt” and “burn” and promised fast results are everywhere.  I have a different experience and a different approach. 

Pilates isn’t about performing.  It’s not even about getting “in shape”, and certainly not a quick fix.  And if your goal is to be “in shape” for swimsuit season you probably need to start in December, not now.  And if making your body look a certain way is your goal, that’s fine. But that truly takes many hours a week of practice. Ask yourself if that’s how you want to spend all your free time. An hour of Pilates a week won’t make you look like a dancer... dancers train many many hours a week for years to look like they do! 

Pilates is a practice.  A lifelong practice for improving your life.  Posture, balance, coordination, strength and flexibility are some benefits.  But focus, awareness, stress relief and concentration are also benefits.  The mindbody aspects are very vital to the practice.  How you feel and move are far more important than what you’re body looks like.  Being thin and toned aren’t indicative of being healthy and happy.  The truth is many people who present themselves as models of healthy living workout too much and eat too little and create unrealistic and unreachable ideals that most people won’t reach with a truly healthy life.  

 Pilates was designed for health of body and mind.  Doing fancy advanced exercises isn’t right for everyone and they don’t give you better results.  Just simply practicing with consistency will give you results.  And practice doesn’t need to make “perfect”.  The practice itself is the reward.  Of course you will improve and the more you progress the more you’re capable of but it’s not some ladder to perfection and if you can’t do teaser you’re failing. Some people should not even  to aim for teaser. People have different bodies and the beauty of Pilates is that you can adapt it to your body.  Find what works best for you and practice. Don’t worry about how it looks or if the “right” muscle is engaging. Working with a skilled teacher is invaluable but if that’s not possible just practice on your own. Let the practice be the end result.  Not a size.  Not a perfect exercise. Getting done with your routine and feeling great, being able to live your life with less pain and more ease is far better results than fitting into some special number size or being able to do a fancy exercise.  Do it for yourself and cherish the benefits you create."

The tissue becomes quite tight and uncomfortable during reaching/lengthening movements or taking legs away from the body.

We did find having a Pilates ball under the lower back assisted the pulling.

I plan on researching further some exercises to assist core activation and lower back conditioning, but if anyone has recommendations or similar experiences that have worked for them I'd love to hear!"

pilates,Open Leg Rocker Progress,"This move has been hard for me! I used to think that maybe I had trouble because I’m tall (strange, I know. I had this idea that taller people aren’t as flexible...). I had watched several videos on YouTube on progressions, and how to master this, but still no dice. Anyway, I got a book from Brooke Siler (The Pilates Body) breaking down a bunch of moves, and wow! After months of struggling to do a proper OLR, my body actually figured out what to do.

In addition to the instructions and tips she stated, I started out by bending my knees to my chest and holding onto my legs right above my ankles. I did a few rocks back and forth to get into the groove of balancing and controlling the movement. After doing a few sets of those, my legs started straightening out in preparation to rock, and stayed straight throughout the movement! 

What I changed:
-tucking my chin to my chest
-making sure to engage my core enough (obvious, but tougher movements can cause sloppiness in the familiar components)
-not trying to pull my legs in as much, thus also keeping my arms pretty straight
-relaxing my mind, and letting intuition flow a bit more

GLTA, and I hope you also find a breakthrough in moves that you struggle with!"

pilates,Valgus knees after hip replacement (anterior) + knees don't straighten all the way - any tips?,"Hello!  


I'm working with an elderly client who's had anterior hip replacement and has valgus knees as a result. We do mostly standing and sitting work, since she can't get down and up from the mat/floor easily, at most she can lie down on the couch. A reformer and other equipment isn't available, since it's online.  


Would appreciate any tips/exercises to correct the issue without additional equipment."
pilates,Pilates for “transformation”,Summer is approaching and the “swimsuit body“ marketing floodgates have started to gush that tired old nonsense.  Pilates is for your well being all year long.  Transforming a body takes time and a 2 week challenge isn’t really effective. Finding the exercises that you will do consistently is the key. Pilates was never meant to be a “get fit quick” scheme.  It’s a practice that transforms from the inside out and isn’t really about how you look. But I guess feeling good and functioning well isn’t sexy 😂

pilates,Pilates and chronic pain,"A personal note on Pilates and pain…
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you struggle with chronic fatigue, chronic pain, autoimmune issues, flare ups, low energy or any other ailment that impacts how you feel in your body day to day, I see you and I hear you.

My first few years of Pilates were not about getting ripped or getting a good sweat in. Honestly they still aren’t! I don’t talk about this often on social media, but thanks to a genetic disorder (EDSh) I spend time moving my body to keep my shoulder from dislocating, to keep my knee in place and to ease my back pain. My Pilates foundation has been an amazing arsenal of tools for me to care for my body that I”m so grateful I have access to. But even with the best toolbox, there are going to be crappy days.

A few things I’ve learned on my Pilates and wellness journey...
1.Ask yourself what your body needs, and what resources you have to care for yourself. You may feel like you need to move for an hour but have limited energy levels today. Or the reverse. Take needs and resources into account and try to balance those.

2.Get outside. If you do nothing else today, take a step outside. I know that can feel like a-lot on more intense days. Even if its for 1 minute, drag yourself to the door and get a few breaths of fresh air.

3.Let go of expectations that no longer serve you. I’ve always wanted a 6 pack. That’s just not what I’m energetically available to pursue right now. I let that shit go. If I’m going to spend time moving it’s to take care of my body, not to make it look a certain way. 

4.Ask for help. As much as you can, use your support systems around you!

5.Compassionately ignore well meaning but hurtful comments. You know the ones I’m talking about.

6. Play around with playful bursts of movement. Maybe you aren’t up for an hour workout, totally fine. Are you up for 5 minutes of mobility or breath work on the mat?"
pilates,"Pilates, Flow state &amp; functional fitness",I’m seeing lots of talk about “feeling the burn” and seeing the “hot girl bikini body” challenges and I would like to offer a different perspective on Pilates.   Pilates is a full mind body practice.  It’s not about targeting your abs or using x amount of weight.  The physical exercises are meant to bring you to the flow state where movement and meditation meet. True well being is about so much more that what you look like. It’s about having a more relaxed body and mind. Enjoying movement with ease. Being able to do the things you love in your life.  Toning up your butt is a secondary benefit... being able to squat down and stand up while doing chores or hiking without pain are far more important. This fixation on being toned and thin isn’t about health. Pilates was not intended to be just physical.  It’s not about doing the exercises perfectly.  It’s a practice and with time it’s effects are going to improve every aspect of your life.  Don’t be intimidated by the teachers showing off advanced moves in skin tight clothes.   Pilates is much more than that and it’s adaptable for everyone as long as you’ve got a teacher who understands the holistic nature of the work.  Focusing on moving and breathing instead of trying to engage the “right” muscles can make it both more pleasant and more effective.   I’ve seen a teacher here telling someone to make their abs feel like they do when vomiting and I just can’t abide with that terrifying nonsense.  Please embrace the benefits of moving gently and letting the practice evolve over time. After 31 years of practicing I continue to expand my understanding of this method and the more I relax into the flowing and breathing the better my body and mind feel.  The practice itself is the end result.  And if you want a bikinis body just put the bikini on your body.
pilates,could someone explain why 1lb weights are used so much in pilates?,"I find for myself that 1lb weights are too easy. I prefer 3 lb for pilates flows however I hear all the time on online platforms (such as mellisa wood health) to try to ""challenge"" yourself to do just 1lb. I do have a gym/sports history so I might literally just be strong. I tend to not get as good of a burn burn with 1lb weights but I swear  3lb feels right. 

&amp;#x200B;

does anyone know why the lighter the weight the better? does it matter?

also just general theory as to why light weights are preferred ?"
pilates,"Just started, on day 14! Need some advice.","Hi, 
A lot of the exercises seem to need you to straighten your legs straight up and then do various movements. I am battling to straighten my legs fully and know this probably just take stretching but can anyone recommended any stretches/exercises to help with this. Thanks!"
pilates,Focus on Movement instead of muscles,"I’ve been doing Pilates myself since 1989 and teaching it since 1995. So it’s fair to say I am quite experienced.  I’ve seen Pilates grow from a barely known niche to a worldwide phenomenon but I see more misinformation about it the more widely it is spread.  So many people think it’s “for your abs” and the fixation of tightening up the abdominal muscles as a solution to pain or posture is widespread.  

Pilates is a system of movement.  No one muscle is magic and focusing on muscles too much usually brings extra tension. The exercises are movements and if you focus on the body moving and finding healthy movement mechanics the “right” muscles will do their jobs.  Pilates real genius is that these exercises teach the body and mind to work harmoniously as a whole.

If you’re learning Pilates and struggling with back pain and are trying to keep your abdominal muscles tight all the time while exercising I encourage you to switch your focus to breathing and moving gently and fluidly. See how it feels to focus on what your spine is doing in the “ab” work.  Our abdominal muscles move our spine so ab exercises are spine exercises.  Tightening up the abs will tighten up the spine and make movements tight and that isn’t beneficial. Finding fluidity of breath, movement and flowing through the exercises with mental focus and physical efficiency is the goal, not “tight abs”."
pilates,Brooklyn/NYC studios that would be welcoming/ok with obese clients?,"Hi, I'm interested in trying out pilates, but I'm obese, very unfit, and very self conscious. I'd love to find an in-person studio where I could book a private session (will be fully vaccinated soon) but I'm nervous about finding a place that would be ok with me. Is there a database to find instructors, or do you guys happen to know of any in Brooklyn? I am hoping for in person instead of virtual because I'm not very aware of my body and I think I'll need the in person guidance, and possibly some of the equipment/props. Thank you so much!!!"

pilates,How do Pilates Instructors get paid? (In the U.S),"I have seen the question being asked about pay rates/ salaries but I’m actually wondering HOW we are instructors paid and not how much. As in is it usually in cash? Are you an employee? Are you self employed? Which is better? Pros/cons? Ideally I’d love to be self employed and get paid in cash (u def the table 😅) similar to dance studios or yoga studios.. but not sure how it works..

I attained my comprehensive certification at the beginning of the Pandemic and therefore wasn’t able to go straight into the workforce. Live in a major city that just barely reopened fitness facilities. So in the meantime I’ve just been doing Pilates for myself and privates for some friends...however now that the world is reopening I’m getting ready to find a job."
pilates,New to sub and looking for info/suggestions,"Hello I am excited I found this sub. Been doing some kind of mat Pilates for a long time, had a few vhs video tapes before they could call it Pilates!

Anyway, I have been having some pain issues that Pilates has been helping and my physical therapist has approved me doing it, especially since it has been helping me. I took my first reformer class earlier in the week and realized I can probably do quite a few of the reformer exercises on my Weider Ultimate Body gym. I saw a lot of reformer exercise charts online and was wondering if people on this sub have a favorite.

I am looking to switch out my current lower body exercise days to Pilates, are there recommendations for YouTube or apps that focus on weak glutes, hips, outer rotators that you really like?

I am also considering having an instructor come to my home to see if they can show me some moves on my machine, how much would that cost? Class sessions are about $40 where I live.

My goal is to do something 2-3x/week.

Thanks!"
pilates,Pilates and covid,"Hi girls! So, I received my covid diagnosis today after going go three different clinics where doctors would tell me I was just having panic attacks (my only symptom was shortness of breath). I believed them, since they are doctors. You know how your instructor is always saying that you should listen to your body because your body knows best? Well, I listened to my body and my body told me I was not having panic attacks and I demanded a swab. Turns out I was right and I'm covid positive. I know this doesn't have to do with Pilates itself, but I just wanted to share how the principles of pilates helped me trust in myself and my symptoms ❤️ and I wanted to tell you to trust your bodies and your guts. They know what is right and what is wrong. 

Hope you have a lovely weekend!"

pilates,Review: Peloton Pilates with Ally Love,"I took two Ally Love classes this week: a 10 minute class and a 30 minute intermediate class. I am willing to bet, based on her classes, that she was a Pilates instructor for a while before joining Peloton. She reminded me of ways to engage my core that I sometimes forget. 

I was surprised that the 10 minute class was more challenging than the one labeled “Intermediate.” I believe it is because many of these shorter classes are higher intensity. I loved her style of teaching, and I plan to repeat her 10 minute class often. I was not a fan of the 30 minute class, only because I felt it could have been shorter and I could have done some other form of workout to burn some calories and maximize my time. If you really need to focus on breath, form, and knowledge of the Pilates practice the 30 minute class is a good one to take."
pilates,Lower back pain after a class focusing on the tower ?,"Hi. I’m 25 and pretty active. I have been doing Pilates for about a year now and recently my instructor started introducing the tower. 
I take semi private lessons and Pilates has helped so much with my neck pain and posture but after my class on Wednesday I am not feeling too great. 
During the one hour class we used the chair as well as the tower. We did a lot of crunches using the breathing bar and it was mainly abs and shoulder focused. 
Later that night and today my lower back hurts pretty bad. The pain is right in the middle and feels kind of like a pinch which comes and goes. Maybe an ache and pinch are the best way to describe it. I feel I’m not walking as straight either.. it just feels weird. 
It’s only the second day so I’ll see how I feel as the week progresses but has this happened to anyone else ?
I’ve never had an injury in Pilates and my instructor mentioned no risks came from the tower since it was pretty beginner friendly but now I’m a little nervous. 
Am I overreacting or should I start to be concerned."
pilates,The best way of Learning Pilates,"I’m seeing so many posts of people seeking the best video to learn Pilates with.  And it may be unpopular but my opinion is that you can not learn Pilates effectively from any video!  Pilates was created to be taught human to human with the teachers skills of choosing the best exercises and watching and cueing the students based on what they need as an individual.  Once you’ve got a good understanding of the work you can do your own workout and then a video is quite useful because you understand the exercises and your body.   You know how to adjust for any injuries or issues as well as how to modify any exercise to suit you.  The real power of Pilates is in development your body awareness and learning how to move efficiently and fluidly and what cues and exercises you need are going to be unique.  As a beginner it’s truly best to learn from a human who is watching you and guiding you in real time.  In a studio or zoom doesn’t matter so much but private, semi private sessions or smaller classes like it was originally taught.  Even just a few private sessions can make a world of difference.   If you’re struggling to “learn” Pilates I’d encourage you to find a real human to start the learning process and build a practice that works for you before trying these videos that don’t relate to your individual needs."

pilates,How long should you do pilates before you enroll in instructor training? or how many classes?,"For context, I have been doing classes (small basic mat classes 2 times a week, reformer once a week) for about 2 months now.  I have seen big improvements in my core strength and my ability to control my body.  I have a background in anatomy and would love to get certified to teach at some point in the next year or two.  My motivation for teaching is partially to be able to teach part time for fun (I have another career that is my main source of income), but my main motivation is to gain a deep understanding of the techniques and really hone my skills. 

Other context, I have an instructor that focuses on the basics in a very clear manner, which is why I think I like the classes so much.  I love how the corrections she gives.  I am planning on taking the mat 1 course at the studio with her when I am ready. 

Main questions - How will I know that I am ready for instructor training? when will I get the most out of it? are there any books i should read in the meantime?

My mum is turning 65 soonish, and unfortunately does not do any kind of physical exercise apart from walking to the subway station to work (she's a psychoanalyst so she sits all day)

She has a lot of good &amp; bad reasons:

\- she works a lot, sometimes till very late (after people finish their shift)

\- Paris is currently in lockdown

\- she lives by herself (no one at home for a bit of motivation)

\- she thinks a bike is easy to be stolen

The list goes on.

So I was thinking about buying her pilates classes for her birthday! (for after the lockdown, if it ends)

Why pilates? Because it looks fun, she could make friends, and could help her to develop muscles, flexibility, balance, etc

Yes or no? if no, any other sport reco? 

Thanks a lot"
pilates,Extremely painful low back after Pilates?,"Yesterday I had a random attack while at work where my lower back was extremely tight thus making me a little hunched over and hard to walk. I took a steaming hot shower and felt better the rest of the night so I’m hoping it doesn’t come back. I’m not sure if it’s from Pilates since two days prior I had my second session. My husband said that’s normal after a workout but my instructor said no way it’s from our session (especially two days later) and only mild discomfort would be normal. I’m just paranoid because I have a herniated disc in my L5, which is why I started Pilates to begin with. I’ve heard Pilates does AMAZING things to heal the back but I’m in a vicious cycle where I’m also scared it will make things worse. So do you all think this could really just be my body adjusting?"

My insurance said I would have to submit a claim but also include a diagnostic code.. I can’t get my instructor to give me one because they don’t deal with insurance. What do I do in this situation? Should I switch studios? I doubt any bill insurance though. Also, the owner of the practice is a PT but the instructor she assigned me to is not so would finding one who is a PT give me a better chance of getting it covered?"

pilates,Align Pilates Combo Chair III,"Hi, 

I made a post a week ago here about the Balanced Body Exo Chair ([https://www.reddit.com/r/pilates/comments/mgbfew/balanced\_body\_exo\_chair/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pilates/comments/mgbfew/balanced_body_exo_chair/)) and received helpful comments which made me rethink my decision about the BB Exo due to the lack of handles. 

I am now looking into the Align Pilates Combo Chair III ([https://align-pilates.com/products/combo-chair/combo-chair-iii/](https://align-pilates.com/products/combo-chair/combo-chair-iii/)) which is $1k cheaper than the BB Combo Chair and $400 cheaper than the Exo in Australia.

The Align Pilates Combo Chair will have handles, eyelets for use with resistance bands and has a total of 4 springs (in 2 spring strengths, strong and extra strong). Also, instead of using a dowel for single pedal operation, it uses a locking slider underneath the pedals. (I use the BB Combo and Exo when I go to my pilates studio for chair classes and the dowel rattles while it is inserted at times which can be quite annoying/distracting. This issue appears to be more pronounced in the BB Combo. Has anyone experienced similar issues or is there a technique to insert the dowel to avoid this.)

I can't seem to find any reviews about the Align Pilates Combo Chair III. Keen to hear from anyone who has used or currently uses this chair. 

Thank you in advance."

For example, maybe your 3rd grade teacher taught you the best way to stretch your groin was to sit on your bum with the soles of the feet together and then push down really hard on your knees.

pilates,Stott pilates or Polestar pilates? Which certification should I take?,"Hi everyone! I’m a pilates enthusiast that just recently decided to take up a mat certification for my upcoming move overseas (where it’ll be extremely expensive to keep up with privates). The reason for taking it up is purely for my own pilates practice and I have little intention to actually become an instructor (at least not right now or in the near future).

I’ve looked at my local training courses and have come across two options: (1) Stott Pilates Intensive Mat Program or (2) Polestar Pilates Gateway Mat and Gateway Equipment. Both of which begin in July. 

Stott seems to be a very well rounded course but what scares me is the completion of the extra minimum hours of observation, physical review and practice teaching— I essentially have to complete it all by September because that’s when I move overseas... is that a realistic goal to achieve? 

On the other hand, the Polestar option seems viable for people who want a general introduction to pilates principles. 

What are your thoughts? Do just let me know any of your opinions on both methods as well— I’m not well-versed in which is a more reputable pilates method etc.

pilates,Balanced Body Exo Chair,"Hi, 

I am looking at buying a Wunda Chair and am deciding between the Balanced Body Exo Chair or Combo Chair. I watched a review of the Exo Chair ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7tUlY7BsSc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7tUlY7BsSc)) which spoke highly of the Exo compared to the Combo noting that on the Exo:

\- the springs are in the centre of the chair (vs outer), 

\- there are only two springs (vs four);

\- the pedal height does not change even though springs might be on different settings on the cactus; 

\- the pedals are attached to a wood base and the pedals feel sturdier as a result.

I also live in a small apartment and expect to continue to do so and appreciate the fact that the Exo is only 16kg in weight which will make it easy to move around if necessary. The Exo is also highly rated on Amazon and more affordable.

My only hesitation is the lack of handles. Keen to hear from Exo Chair owners. (Do you miss not having handles? Are you getting much use out of the resistance bands?) For context, I am new to chair pilates and am currently taking lessons but have been going to pilates reformer for a few years though still consider myself to be a beginner. 

Also, out of interest, how much does the Exo Chair go for in other countries? I'm in Australia and the Exo is $2640 and the Combo is $3245.

I have been taking pilates classes on and off over the last 15+ years, starting with mat pilates at my local Gold’s gym. Although I can’t remember the “brand” of mat pilates, the instructor was fantastic and I always left class feeling like I’d worked every part of my body and still felt invigorated. 10 years ago I purchased a 5-spring reformer from AeroPilates for use at home. It was one of their better machines, but it is not studio quality and was built to fold for storage.  You might be surprised that the “thunk” you feel when you pass over the area where it folds always bothered me. But, to its credit, it’s held up fairly well through the last decade and several moves. That is until the last one move lol.  During my Aug. 2020 move from one state to another, despite wrapping everything with moving plastic wrap (that’s what it looks like) the movers managed to somehow lose both of my shoulder rests and some other small pieces and things have now become dire in the pilates area of my home lol.  On the other hand, I’ve been looking to upgrade for a while now and this is a good opportunity as it doesn’t really make sense to purchase the replacement items and not put that money into a well cared for second hand reformer (the shoulder rests on my current reformer were quoted to me at a rather expensive price for the quality, to the point that I could purchase one of their low end reformers for almost the same price, if I remember correctly).  

So, after over a year of research and trial, I’ve decided that I want to replace my current reformer with an Allegro 2 from Balanced Body (I particularly like the completely adjustable foot bar that you can move up and down the reformer, among many other things). But, I’ve been really surprised that there aren’t more second hand/used ones.  At least not that I could find through Google searches, Facebook groups, Craigslist and yes, I even checked eBay for listings.  I’m not sure the lack of ones for sale is due to their quality and  so studios and individuals hold onto them forever, or if there is far more demand since Balanced Body is on an 8-10 week lead time.  In the last few years I’ve had some medical issues that have prevented my from doing very much and I am already limited as most of the vertebrae in my thoracic region were fused when I was younger.  Basically, pilates is pretty perfect for me because of the lack of compression on the spine. So, I’m pretty desperate to start moving again and have been on the lookout. I know I could get a lot of different machines, but I’d like to acquire a reformer now that I’m going to have for a very long time and I both love the Allegro 2’s performance as well as how it looks.  If anyone has any advice on any of the above, especially if you have any experience with the Allegro 2 and can add any useful knowledge on that front, I’d really appreciate it. If you’ve had luck finding and purchasing this equipment somewhere, or what to expect with regards to price second hand, I’d also love to know all about it.  I may end up having to purchase a new reformer, but I know people generally take very good care of their machines and I do like the idea of taking advantage of the second hand market if possible.  

I appreciate any and all information and thank you in advance for taking the time to read my post. I hope to be around as I spring back into my pilates journey.  Wishing everyone a great week and good health!"

pilates,Best resources for difficult classical matwork videos that don't involve standing?,"Where do you get classical matwork videos that don't involve standing?

I have a form of arthritis that affects my feet. As much as I love the Reformer, I can really only do the chair, the matwork, and some of Cadillac exercises, some of the time, because I can't put pressure on my feet during a flare, without making it worse.

pilates,Interested in becoming an instructor,"Hi! So, I've been doing pilates for three years now and I love it since I love exercise In general but I hate going to the gym. I've been thinking in becoming a pilates instructor just for the sake of it, it's not my intention to work as an instructor, I just would like to learn and pracrice by my own in case I can't go to the studio (I don't know how people who live in Europe/US pay for the classes, it looks so expensive!!). The thing is that I'm not flexible at all. I can't keep my legs straight for every exercise and I'm not the greatest when doing abs. Do you think I can still study to become an instructor? I don't want to be frustrated.

Also, I'm moving to Italy hopefully this year and I was wondering if pilates is a big thing there since, as I mentioned, prices vary a lot in comparison to the classes in Latin America (if you come here, you'll be paying very cheap for very complete pilates classes).  I just want to plan my trip ahead. It's funny that most of the people who move abroad are concerned about missing their families/friends but my biggest concern is ""where will I practice Pilates?!!"""
pilates,Should I join a Pilates class? (chronic pain and social anxiety),"**TL;DR: Can Pilates help with postural issues and chronic pain? Does it also help with weightloss? And lastly, when you join a class do instructors help work with your limitations? Instead of throwing you in with the other students expecting you to catch up?** 

Apologies for the length, but I really want help and want to make sure I don't leave anything out: 

So, since I was in middle school I've always had chronic pain in my upper back and neck. 

I've done several treatments such as epidural injections, chiropractic care, physical therapy, muscle relaxers, medical marijuana, etc. As well as gotten different tests (x-ray's and mri's several times over the years), and never given an answer on what's causing the pain nor gotten any relief from pain. I have scoliosis, but I was told that wouldn't cause the pain. 

Anyway, a few years ago, one of my physical therapists told me I should try Pilates. And that it might help with my postural issues, pain, and tight muscles. I did not do this because I was too anxious to join a class. And was not motivated enough to practice it at home myself. 

I am not flexible at all. I cannot touch my toes. I cannot lift myself up lying down on my back unless I put my hands on the floor to support myself. I also have poor posture. I have what appears to be hyperlordosis, and only recently seem to be developing a really bad forward neck posture which is gradually getting worse. 

**I think the REAL source of my pain, which I've only recently come to realize is because I've lived a sedentary lifestyle since middle school until now.** I was a recluse for several years due to crippling social anxiety, so I stayed in bed almost all day, only getting up to use the restroom or grab food while I laid in bed on my laptop or watched tv. 

Cut to now, I have a 9-5 job which causes me to sit in front of a computer all day, and when I get home, I just wanna lay down and go to sleep the rest of the evening. 

The pain has only gotten worse, and I think now I really need to commit to changing my lifestyle before things get worse than it is now. So far, I've consistently practiced Pilates from youtube videos that I watched online for about 2 weeks. I seem to like it so far, but I think I'll see real progress in a class. Because I'm unsure if I'm practicing proper breathing and form. Thing is, I still have a bit of social anxiety...which comes to my questions:

1. When a beginner joins a new Pilates class, do they usually have you jump in doing what everyone else is doing in the class expecting you to catch up? I worry about this a lot. When I was around 11 years old, I tried joining a martial arts class, they decided to put me in with the teenagers and adults because only 10 and under is the kids class and I was 11.  On day one, they had me jumping in doing all these painful exercises and I was the only one who couldn't catch up and was being knocked down a ton. I was embarrassed and a couple of the other teenagers were laughing at me. They also paired me up with an adult woman who was throwing punches at me (I had to hold a padded thing for her to punch and kick) and I kept getting knocked down and was just embarrassed. I told my mom to get me out of that class that same day. And cried on the way home. I really don't want another experience like that again. So, I just wanna know if the instructor really works with you and your limitations...not just throw you in there. I'm an adult now, and I am working on my anxiety issues, but I still have some fears and would like some reassurance. 
2. Can this help with my postural issues? I'm really hoping to correct it. I want to have proper posture. 
3. Is it possible to lose weight with Pilates? I'm a 5'4 and a half woman weighing 160 pounds, I'd like to lose a couple and build some muscle. 

I appreciate any advice regarding this. Thanks."
pilates,Frustrated by studios marketing classes as “reformer pilates” when really it should be labeled “mat pilates”,"Not sure if this is exclusive to my city but, I have grown increasingly frustrated lately over this. I love reformer pilates because it helps me align my body, the low impact, and the stretching increased by the reformer machine. It helps me work on my abs without placing too much strain on my back which I have a lot of issues with. 

A lot of the studios in my city will offer “reformer” classes but really out of the 50 minute class, we will spend maybe 15-20 minutes on the reformer and the rest on the mat or on that chair-springboard thing. This is soooo frustrating to me because the reason I pay this much for a pilates reformer class is to USE THE REFORMER MACHINE, NOT do a bunch of floor work that frankly are exercises I could easily do at home on my own and lacks the support I crave from the reformer machine. And I’m in the highest level class offered! 

Is this how most studios are? Because I’m very close to bringing it up with the owner, but I don’t want to if this is just standard practice. Also needed to vent after class this morning."

pilates,How often should you do Pilates?,"As a studio owner/instructor I get this question a lot! I thought I’d share some common answers in case anyone else has been wondering the same thing!

How often should I be doing Pilates? Great question! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
How often do you want to be doing Pilates? It's that simple! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The best schedule is one that you genuinely love, look forward to, want to make time for, and is sustainable. That looks different person to person, and even season to season. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Some questions I like to ask anyone looking to build their ideal Pilates schedule...⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Do you do alot of other activities or is Pilates your main form of movement? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Do you feel refreshed after Pilates or like you need to take a few days to recover?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
How much time per week do you think will help you fulfill your Pilates goals or other movement goals in general? ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Are you brand new to Pilates?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Maintain your practice-1x a week
In general, if you are doing other amazing things with your body, have goals of cross training or keeping up your Pilates practice, 1-2x a week is usually awesome! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Improve your practice-2x a week
If you have really specific goals you are working towards that you feel require more dedication, or you want to use Pilates to move more often, I recommend starting at 2x a week. 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Start Pilates for the first time-2-3x/week for 1 month Are you brand new to Pilates? Welcome!!! I have so many exciting things to say if you are brand new, but I'll try to keep it short. The best thing you can do is invest in building a Pilates foundation. That doesn't necessarily mean 3x a week private sessions for the rest of your life! What I have seen work most effectively is 2-3x a week, or at least 6 sessions, your first month. It's just enough to start knowing what to feel and when, get used to new ways of moving, and usually is right about when I see clients starting to feel a lot more confident. From there I suggest evaluating scheduling needs/goals again. Sometimes we lower to 1-2x a week, sometimes we add in groups, sometimes we keep the schedule you already love. That's what I've seen work well, but what works best is what you love!"

Will doing pilates cause my waist to get wider?  I don't want to bulk up or increase my waist size -- I know once one starts lifting the increase in muscle can lead to a bigger waist. I simply want better core strength and more definition in my core muscles, which I thought pilates would be good for.

pilates,I've Become Very Tense in my Lower Stomach and Navel Area as a Result of Pilates,"Hey there,

I started doing pilates 4-5 days per week (one long session and other short 15-minute ones) around the start of the year. I'm learning with an instructor and progressing through the classic contrology system gradually.

I can feel the benefits already, particularly in my lower back which feels stronger and obviously my core too. 

However, I've started to notice that off the mat I've become tense in my lower stomach area and that I'm subconsiously holding my breath a lot and kinda sucking in around my navel area. I'm feeling more anxious and agitated in general, no doubt because I'm not breathing properly and holding that tension in my navel area. This is becoming my default mode and automatic.

I'm almost certain that this is all down to the pilates. The ideas around centreing, and having that tension in your core whilst doing the exercises, drawing your navel in etc.

One thing is that at the moment I am focusing on a lot of the crunching and inward movements like roll-up, rolling like a ball, spine stretch etc. We haven't got into the back extension exercises of contrology yet. Could the lack of extension exercises be causing my problems?

Have any of you experienced anything similar? 

Thanks!"

My cousin has been actively pursuing different types of exercise and as she’s not really the online type, I’ve been helping from time to time with reddit posts for additional information.

She loves doing Pilates and ballet programs at home during the pandemic, but I noticed recently she was plateauing with her usual videos, so I asked her how one would intensify or progressively overload the same exercises, you know, the equivalent of slapping another plate on the bar or running an extra mile. We weren’t sure, and discussed ankle weights and my (very limited knowledge) of those cable machines I’ve seen people do Pilates with which, I assume, can provide increased resistance but have no clue. Anyway, it’s a pretty basic question really- in the world of Pilates, how does one do “more”, absent just repeating exercises for longer? Maybe it depends on the exercise itself or maybe there are just different levels of exercises, or maybe it really does all come down to weight/resistance applied to the body. I have no idea.

pilates,Allegro II bs BB Project X,"I’m pretty excited to have an opportunity to buy a BB Project X machine from a studio that is moving and using the chance to get new equipment. 

The BB machines were originally $10K commercial machines and are selling for $4K with delivery and set up.    Wooden. In good shoe from what I can tell.   Most of them are being bought by regular studio attendees so I think that speaks to the condition of the machines (they wouldn’t sell them to someone they have to see regularly if they don’t function well)

Or I can buy a new Allegro II with box etc.  delivery but no setup for about the same  $4,000.  6-8 week wait. 

I want to pull the trigger on the used one but am nervous it doesn’t make sense when I can get a new one for same

pilates,Pilates for lower cross syndrome &amp; anterior pelvic tilt - help?,"Hey all! So long story short, I'm a college student, and due to my lack of movement from COVID and classes being online, I was very sedentary last semester (despite being active &amp; working out everyday). I was in physical therapy over break since this caused me to experience lower cross syndrome (weak abs &amp; glutes / tight hamstrings &amp; hip flexors) and an anterior pelvic tilt. I'm not in PT anymore since I'm back at school, but I am taking private pilates classes once a week to strengthen my core. I'm also trying to work on moving around move/standing up, and I'm still unable to activate my glutes (literally no matter the exercise - except for one I did in pilates. I need to retrain them I think on how to activate).

I guess my questions are, has anyone else experienced this? What did you do? How long did it take to go away? My hip flexors/hamstrings have been RIDICULOUSLY tight this past week (tighter than ever before), so I'm going to get some dry needling/mysofascial therapy later this week, but I'm just wondering what you think caused that? I've been doing stretches like the backward lunge (with my foot resting on the wall) and the figure 4 stretch. I also have a massage gun. Please help!"

pilates,"Just started my Pilates instructor course in Seoul, Korea","Hi everybody :) 

I started to work out lifting weights ever since I started to have neck/back pain from my office job. Lots and lots of sitting and keyboarding!! 

Lifting weights is an excellent work out no doubt but I realized unless I have a complete understanding of proper form, lifting weights may do more harm than good. 
Which is one of the reason why I transitioned to Pilates. Correct form is also required, I find Pilates is much more forgiving. 

After 3 years of Pilates training I wanted to really dig into it. I also find being an instructor in an activity which I have a lot of faith, is more fulfilling than my current desk job. 

I have nooooo background in Anatomy, so memorizing all the words is a lot of work for me. 😬

I’m struggling with my left hip “hikes up” towards my left shoulder.  I struggle to figure out how to lengthen my side body so my hips are even &amp; aligned.  Drives me nuts as I’ve not been able to correct it in like 6 years of Pilates training/ 1:1s.

Major places when I struggle - if  I’m doing legs springs or even stomach series.  It’s like I just can’t stretch out my core/left leg.  I get a lot of clicking/popping.  I’ve tried getting my glutes more involved - but I just can’t get my body to lower my hip.  

Not sure if anyone has any tips, videos or articles to better break down this issue.

pilates,Pilates for weight loss,"Hey guys

So I’ve been doing CICO since the end of last year, I’ve been doing this successfully and have about 3-4 pounds left to lose before I’m at my ‘goal’ weight. I have been walking an hour and cycling (indoors) half an hour each day. 

I’m 5’3 started at 129, am currently at 122 and goal weight is maybe 119/118. I’m what people may refer to as ‘skinny fat’ so my ideal scenario is to tone my stomach. I have pretty thin legs and I’m toning my butt with cycling / squats. 

I would like to start incorporating Pilates into my regime but I’m a total beginner, I’m looking for some pointers into how long / often I should do this? Also and recommendations for Pilates work out specific to weight loss? I would be doing this from home as my gyms closed in lockdown 

Thanks in advance!"
pilates,Anyone else put down a deposit for the Flexia Pilates reformer? What do you think of the design so far?,"A couple months ago I put down my deposit for the Flexia Pilates reformer, as I'm intrigued by the fact that it's designed to be assembled in your home and seems like one of the most affordable options for the quality of the product (~$2000, with a box and jumpboard included). Plus you can get a full refund at any time up to 30 days after delivery, which I appreciate as a brand new model of reformer that no one has reviewed yet.

Kaleen (the owner/designer) just came out yesterday with photos and video of the prototype and it looks like a beautiful machine! The design is gorgeous and it looks like it's very customizable depending on the body you're working with (I'm a certified instructor and, while I'm not teaching at the moment, may consider taking on private clients in the future).

Does anyone have any thoughts on the design? Anyone else put down a deposit and is excited for delivery?"

I tried to do the intermediate level for the mat challenge but 5 minutes in I realized I was getting too ahead of myself. I know I want to go hard but it was a bit much for me and I do need to slow down in order to get that foundation down and progress. I don’t have the strongest core even from previous workouts but I have no doubt Pilates will help. So I’ll be doing that, Move with Nicole, and some cardio videos. I am pretty excited especially because Pilatesology is rooted in the classical style. I signed up for a free Club Pilates class next month too even though I know it’s not classical, I just want to see how it is since I’ve never done the Reformer machines before.

The problem is, I have no clue where to start. I’m  working out from home because I’m not yet ready to be in anyone’s gym or studio. Does anyone know of any good resources for routines? Though I’m a Pilates beginner, I’ve developed enough strength to be challenged with advance routines.

pilates,The ONE thing that helped with my constant neck and back pain..,"Just wanted to share my experience in managing chronic neck and back pain for close to 20 years now. I've tried almost every solution you can think of -- orthopedics, chiropractic, physiotherapists, massage sessions, yoga etc. but nothing ever seemed to work. I was desperate for a solution when a good friend recommended me these two products (am not affiliated to them in any way, just wanted to put it out there to help a fellow reddit friend) -- The first solution is a massage mat which derives its origins from an ancient Indian healing method which dates back to 5,000 years ago ([https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat](https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat)). Simply by laying on this mat for 20 mins a day, you'll be in a deep state of relaxation, and this really helps to relieve any aches or pain from your neck, shoulder -- all the way to your upper and lower back.

The second item that really helped me with my condition -- in particular my degenerative disks in the cervical region -- is this neck traction device ([https://the-orthorelief.com/](https://the-orthorelief.com/)) which helps to relief pain by gently stretching your neck and spine.

Hopefully this changes someone's life the way it did for mine :') Cheers, and feel free to reach out to me if you need any other tips!"

pilates,Managing fatigue,"Hello,
I’ve been practicing Pilates (mat, reformer, tower) for about 1.5 years, 3-4 times a week, including two 1:1 sessions a week with a lovely instructor. I still consider myself a beginner because of my starting place (zero muscle) and build (larger body, so bodyweight based movement is challenging). 

My question:  some days my Pilates sessions are great...I see actual progress, fluidity of movement, and my muscles feel strong. Other days, the simple “put your legs in shelf” command feels near impossible...cramping and shaking legs, muscular fatigue, and not being able to do moves I could previously do. 

I do walk (swiftly) for cardio exercise, so perhaps some of this fatigue on “bad days” relates to tired muscles. But it’s frustrating!  Any of you experience “off” days where you doubt your progress?  Any of you experience days where the simple, core exercises feel overly hard, despite years of experience?  If so:  anything you do to cope? Any training ideas to minimize days where my muscles feel “off”? 

Thank you!"

The healing has been complicated due to the incision being on the exact site that I had a hernia operation as a teenager, and there has also been nerve damage, resulting in discomfort in my tummy and leg. 

I'm wondering if anyone could suggest particular pilates exercises (or classes, videos, etc) to gently re-engage my abdominal region?

pilates,Diversity and the Pilates Method Alliance,"I haven't seen it discussed here yet so I wanted to bring it up! There is a lot to talk about and I'm probably going to accidentally miss things and I think [Misty Lynne Cauthen](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CKCBH03jUnl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) says it best here.

TL;DR: The PMA is a cashcow (their 2018 financials show they pulled in around 250k of revenue from the conference and the president Elizabeth Andersen earns about 150k as a salary) and absolutely worthless as a professional organization and the NPCP program is the same. The only reason they continue to remain somewhat relevant is because of their stranglehold on continuing education credits. They gatekeep and they tokenize  - where are the male board members? Where are the larger bodied teachers?  How are they promoting and advancing Pilates as a profession exactly? By having a certification that requires CECs? Seems good, thanks. Even post trademark lawsuit (I wasn't a teacher then) I'm not sure they really were working to heal the schism created by Sean Gallagher.

Why this is relevant is oftentimes the advice that is given here with regards to finding a teacher is that a PMA Certified (now NCPT) teacher is best and I bought into that hype myself as a teacher.  I  took the test which incredibly easy - the written test out for the my teacher training program was more difficult so I ticked the box.

Then COVID-19 happened. The PMA response to COVID-19 was lacking with a few blogs and webinars.  Then the murder of George Floyd happened.  Their response to the murder of George Floyd was a blacked out square and a statement and 2 black women (Stella Hull-Lampkin and Nicky Taylor Steward) being appointed to the PMA board and 2 black women (Eurona Tilley and Tabatha Koylass ) being elected to the board.

The [PMA then created a photo contest soliciting photos of diverse instructors](https://www.instagram.com/p/CITKObrABa3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) which was problematic with #diversifypilates.

A few weeks ago there was a PMA town hall meeting.  [Here is the link to the replay](https://www.pilatesmethodalliance.org/Shared_Content/PMA-Blog/Community/Our-Town-Hall-Meeting---Opening-Communication-about-Diversity-in-Pilates.aspx).

On Monday all [4 black board members resigned](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ9IoT7gKiI/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). They had to sign an NDA so effectively they were silenced from day 1. 

My PMA membership is up. I'm not renewing. I don't need discounts on grip socks and generalized advice from a professional organization that doesn't actually seem interested in serving the teachers sustaining the industry. Even if you're not a member, we can hold the single professional org of our industry accountable.

I  have a meeting with Moxie on Monday, but have also seen Talent Hack,  Virtual Studio Space, ClassPass, etc all in the game.  Does anybody have  any feedback on using any of these platforms?  Thank you!!!"
pilates,"After decades of suffering from chronic and excruciating back and neck pain, I finally found my solution.","Hey everyone, thanks for dropping by and hearing me out. I have suffered from chronic back pain for decades now, and have tried all sorts of solutions (including taking supplements, going for pilate classes, spending tens of thousands of dollars to the chiro, massage therapists, orthopedic doctors), but nothing seemed to work! It wasn't until recently when my best friend introduced me this natural healing solution: the acupressure massage mat - which derived from its origin as an ancient Indian relaxation tool for over 5,000 years , and I can't say this enough, but my life has truly changed ever since. Just by lying on this massage mat for 20 minutes a day, my pain score has reduced from a 7/10 to a 3/10, and my quality of life has improved tremendously. I'm not endorsed nor affiliated to them in any way, but here's the link to the massage mat to anyone who's interested to know more how it works: [https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat](https://the-orthorelief.com/products/orthorelief%E2%84%A2-acupressure-massage-mat)"

I’m trialing the Peleton classes now, which include Pilates, and they are downright horrible. I’m looking for well shot, classic classes that use props (but not equipment) and do more different types of moves (not just 100s etc). No fusion-y classes, would prefer if taught by dancer types. Would willingly pay for a subscription.  Not interested as much in piecing together you tube videos. While I love the way the peleton app functions (lots of variety, easy to access, save, sort etc) it’s not geared toward traditional Pilates (clunky and assuming no flexibility). Any recommendations?"

pilates,Suggestions on home reformer with easiest adjustments for different bodies,"Hello! My husband and I are currently weighing our options for purchasing a reformer for our home. He is 7 inches taller than me and almost twice my size. I anticipate that we'll each be adjusting the carriage position, shoulder rests and rope lengths a lot on the machine. 

So far, our top choices are the BB Allegro 2 or the Rialto because of their ease of use, wide footbars and adjustable shoulder pad positions. (and they look beautiful!) 

But I've also been seeing the Merrithew Elevated SPX bundle online, including at a local retailer. While it is more expensive, it comes with several accessories and we could get it delivered to us quickly with the option to include assembly. (Compared to the BB machines, which don't seem to be in stock anywhere and have a long shipping timeline. Especially the Allegro 2.) 

From what I have seen online, the Merrithew is a bit more tedious to adjust, but maybe I'm overthinking it. While I don't find the Stotts as visually appealing as the BB machines, they are clearly super high in quality.

Thoughts? Are the BB reformers worth waiting for, or will we be just as happy with the SPX?"
pilates,My calves are too big to fit between the shoulder rests :/,"I’m not a large woman. I’m average sized and 5’4”, but I have an athletic shape. It bugs the heck out of me that I can’t put my legs side by size between the shoulder rest comfortably. No one ever has this issue in Pilates videos. I guess I should see if any of the men do? I’m guessing the men have the shoulder rests on a wider setting. I don’t have huge shoulders, but athletic shoulders. I think if I widened them they would not work for footwork, etc. Anyone else have this issue?"

pilates,What are your favorite pieces of relatively inexpensive home-use equipment that can be used for Classical Pilates?,"In the past year, I've found five pieces of equipment that are absolutely the bees knees. They are as follows:

1.)  The Pilates Wheel TRX. $250- $275.  It's basically a rolling foot bar with leg and arm straps. You can't do the advanced work with it safely, but it's the closest thing to a Pilates Reformer in terms of actual physics  and feel that I've ever found, that is not a Reformer. (And it's so small you can take its carrying bag an extra suitcase on a plane, without much difficulty.)

2.)  The Pilates Proform Chair from Icon Fitness. This thing costs $200, and again, you can't use it for the advanced work, but it has a slim profile, when folded; it's easy to fold, and you can use it for most online workouts. The only thing I really don't like about it is that you have to be really careful with it on floors.

3.)  The Pilates Arc Spine Corrector. Knockoffs cost less than $100. This is a barrel that has a removable step. It's a big foam barrel that can be used for most Step Barrel and Arc Barrel workouts

4.)  PhysicalMind's TYE.  The PhysicalMind institute is like the high tech rocket-scientist of Pilates--they developed the piston system for the MVE chair. Their newest offering is called a TYE The TYE is wearable bungee cords. The TYE looks incredibly cyberpunk on, and it's a safe way to add 30 pounds of resistance to any Pilates exercise.  

Do you have any recent discoveries for home use equipment? What are they?"
pilates,Thoughts on Pilates Tower and Arc,"Purchased an Allegro2 pilates reformer by Balance Body at the start of Covid and have been enjoying it.

Also curious about getting a Pilates Arc and would love thoughts there, too!"
pilates,Please recommend suitable leggings,"Hi everyone. Not sure this is the place to ask but anyway.

I'm looking for some decent trousers to wear while doing Pilates. During lockdown I just ordered 2 pairs off amazon and they're good enough for Pilates but I really don't like the material because it just accentuates my cellulite. It's 77% polyester and 23% spandex. So I tend to wear these indoors but not out because I just look ridiculous in them.

I would prefer something that is soft to the touch, not those smooth and shiny ones like on fabletics.. There are ones on sports direct that have that more stretchy consistency and aren't as firm, but they're more forgiving on the cellulite areas but I'm looking for better rated ones. Thanks x"
pilates,How often do you practice Pilates?,I started an unlimited membership at my local Pilates place. It’s all new to me. How often do you all practice Pilates?

pilates,Shoulders started popping and clicking from practicing Pilates?,"Hi everyone! I’ve been practicing Pilates for a little over a year and I love it. The only negative thing that I’ve experienced is this weird worsening pop/ click in my shoulders when I make a conscious effort to keep my shoulders back and down. It used to only happen every once in a while but now it happens every time I adjust my shoulders to correct my posture.

It doesn’t hurt, but it’s loud enough that someone next to me can hear it. Is this noise a sign that I’m doing something wrong in my practice? I can’t seem to find anything online that offers an explanation besides injury — and nothing is hurting me. But my shoulders never did this before I started Pilates.

If anyone has experienced something similar or has any advice, I’d love to hear from you!"
pilates,How do I know when I'm ready to progress from beginner to intermediate?,"Hi Reddit! So I started doing some beginners mat pilates videos on Youtube a couple months ago (I've been primarily doing Move With Nicole) and while the arm portions of the exercises are still a little challenging bc I'm still trying to figure out modifications that work (I'm hypermobile all over and have hyperextended elbows so I have to be extremely careful doing planks, pushups, or any exercises on all fours and I often opt for the forearms instead), the other exercises are starting to feel a lot easier - still feels good, but I'm not necessarily shaking or anything. 

So I was wondering - is that a sign I can start moving onto intermediate videos? Or should I stick with beginner's for a few more weeks, and just try longer beginner videos? (I started on October 21st of this year and usually work out 4-5 days a week for about 30-40 min at a time, but no one video is longer than 28 minutes max). How can I tell when I'm prepared/ready to move onto a higher level? 

For context, I'm 30 years old and my whole life, I've been extremely weak and easily fatigued, with absolutely no strength anywhere in my body - not in my core, not in my legs, not in my arms, nowhere. A few years ago I did a month with a personal trainer and when evaluating me, she asked if I had been injured recently bc I was so weak - but no; I was just born that way! I literally failed every PE class from first grade all the way through high school. Because I only learned I was hypermobile a few years ago, I would also easily get injured whenever I tried to exercise and as such would usually give up after 3 days working out on my own- I genuinely never made it past 3 days in any exercise program EVER - no exaggeration.

All of that to say  — this is the first time in my entire life I've been consistent enough with exercise to feel like I've made any sort of progress — so I genuinely have no frame of reference for how to tell how much progress I've made, and because of my past history with getting injured when I push myself too far too quickly, I'm wary of just trying an intermediate video to see if I can do it in case I'm not and I end up hurting myself and ending up out of commission once again. 

So Reddit- how can I tell, and what would you say is a safe way to gently push myself further? Thanks in advance for the advice!"

pilates,Balanced Body Rialto or Peak Pilates Fit?,"I’m trying to decide between these 2 reformers. I’m not seeing a complete list of features on the Fit that I can compare to the Rialto. Or maybe the Fit has fewer features?

I recently got a Pilates mat certification through Power Pilates and was wondering since now everything has gone virtual how are recently certified  pilates instructors practicing their teaching through virtual classes? Any tips for someone who is ready to start teaching virtual group mat classes? Where to start? How to reach out to potential new clients? 

Thanks!"
pilates,"Can some explain to me the rationale behind the ""straight spine"" of Classical Pilates?","Around here, the two main branches are Stott and Classical, with the former being more popular. I've met people who were working with Classical teachers and were having problems. When I inquired more, I was shocked to learn that the Classical end goal is a totally straight spine, lacking any cervical, thoracic or lumbar curves.

This doesn't make sense to me. I understand this is also what Joseph Pilates himself taught and believed, but how can this be a good thing? I have great faith in much of the results of Pilates, but this straight spine thing puzzles me.

In the case of a 9-, 12-, 15- or 22-year-old ballet dancer, who has been training their body since childhood, perhaps I could entertain this might be possible and might even be a good thing, depending upon the body. But take your average ""Western body"", say of a 40- or 60-year-old, who have really exaggerated spinal curves (cerv., thor. and lumb. curves, not rotational scoliotic curves) and try to train their spine to be straight...I just don't see it happening, ever and could possibly lead to injury, depending upon the body. I see those curves reducing some, maybe even a lot, but I don't see it healthy or possible or desirable to ever achieve a straight spine for older Western bodies.

So I never refer clients to Classical teachers, because I don't trust their methods. Or at least I haven't yet met one that I trust. I've had clients with very good results with Stott or other versions that don't force a straight spine.

I used to think that, no, surely they must be mistaken or I am misunderstanding what they mean by ""straight spine"", but time and time again, I have been corrected that a straight spine is exactly what the Classical people mean.

Or another way to put it - has anyone here benefited beyond any shadow of doubt by the Classical straight spine methods? Was your spine curved but now totally straight and your body is as happy as a clam now?"
pilates,"What are the ""branches"" of Pilates?","I started taking Pilates so long ago that they were still in the midst of legal battles about whether you could use the Pilates name, if you weren't trained in the New York studios by Romana.

Since then, it's become apparent that Pilates looks different, different places.

Stott Pilates teaches something that is in some ways different from the PMA exercises.

Peak Pilates and Balanced Body teach a little differently from the third and fourth generation teachers from the New York Studios.

Pilates taught in England is not what I originally learned. There are entire series of exercise that I'd never seen, unless they were from people trained in England.

Some California studios that don't follow the New York model also seem to teach some different things. 

If you have experienced different branches of Pilates, what are they, and what's the best book or video for that style?"

pilates,Pilates Reformer for home suggestion,"Looking for a reformer to purchase for in-home use. I’ve been doing Pilates on the mat for about 8 months very consistently and would like to broaden my workouts by bringing a reformer into the picture. The Pilates app I use has both mat and reformer classes for every level. I’ve been athletic all my life and would love the challenge a reformer could provide. It does not need to be moveable. I’d like to keep the cost under $3500, but also don’t want to spend more than I need to. There are some pretty inexpensive choices, but not sure they are worth it. Any suggestions?"
pilates,Pilates routine,"Hello all, I’m relatively new to pilates and I’ve gotten into it a lot more since my fiancé is an instructor, i was wondering how people created routines? 

I learn from my fiancé but she has a lot on her plate as it is so i thought I’d try and learn by myself so that we could work out together later, I’ve been using an app called 5 minute pilates and i think its $1.99 per month? 

Anyways, its a decent app and gets the job done but i feel like there’s so many exercises i don’t know which ones to start with.

I went on a spree of doing pilates for 30 minutes every day for about 5 days after getting home from work and it literally destroyed my body with fatigue. I felt so tired and sleepy in the days after, could anyone recommend any tips or advice? Or their experience in starting pilates? 

Thanks!"
pilates,Experience with Merrithew / STOTT PILATES SPX reformer for home use,I have the Balanced Body Allegra and I love it. I got it at Costco. My mother wants to get something similar but now they have the  Merrithew / STOTT PILATES SPX instead. Anyone with experience with that? How sturdy is it?
pilates,Has anyone tried the Proform Pilates chair from Icon fitness?,"It's a Pilates chair that folds up and uses bands for resistance.  I've had three other chairs:  Malibu Pilates, which felt really unstable and just has the wrong geometry; Balanced Body High/Low split, which had no padding on the pedals, and felt too high and unstable, and had a seat that seemed too small; Peak Pilates high/low, which is more like a regular Wunda chair with the slightly larger seat, padded pedals, and the High Chair add on.  Of the three, I really liked the Peak Pilates studio chair best.

But, because of cost and lack of space, I'm not likely to have another Peak chair.  I also have worked with bungee cord Reformers, and bungees for Tower Work. I prefer them, because they're less scary if one breaks. (Springs are fantastic until they break.)

I'm just wondering if anyone has used the Proform Chair. It has a bigger seat and it has bungees. It folds up, and it's relatively inexpensive for a Pilates chair."

Few weeks ago I tried a pilates workout and I really liked it, more than usual fitness and gym workouts. I've started doing pilates everyday. I wonder if doing pilates eveyrday will help me be more toned, without losing muscles with too much cardio?

Other than that. I think I need to eat more because I don't eat a lot, my problem is that I feel full with a bit of food, and I'm not really hungry during the day. I think maybe to lose that bodyfat I need to increase my calories, I think my body could be used to me eating less and thats why my body fat is stubborn. Like my body adapted to the situation. Its a challenge since I'm never physically hungry and also I feel full too early."

pilates,Allegro Mat Conversion,"Since everyone is home due to the pandemic, I have limited space in my home. I am using the formal living room in my home as my office, Pilates “studio”, and relaxation space. I was using my foyer as my “studio” where I stored my padded mat, yoga mat, weights, etc. I have since purchased an Allegro reformer which takes up my entire “studio” space, and the rest of the space in this room is very limited for the mat workouts I do live Via zoom. I don’t have a tower, but would it be worth it to get the mat conversation to place on the reformer so I could still do my mat workouts there? Is the Allegro large enough with the conversation to do roll ups, side lying work, work on all fours, etc? It might be nice to not have to throw down a fold up mat and just do my mat workouts on the clean sturdy space on the reformer."

pilates,Repairing small holes in apparatus vinyl?,"Guys....

My cats have never taken an interest in my reformer. Lo and behold, one day my crazy cat decided he was going sharpen his claws on my Balanced Body studio reformer bed AND on my mats (conversion to tower).

Both are not visible to the eye at the moment. I can feel the small bumpy puncture marks on one corner of my reformer bed. I only feel like 3 little puncture marks on my mat.

Needless to say, they are not allowed in that room anymore and I cover everything with a big blanket now.

I'm 25 now and with everything being too small for me and me gaining weight recently has caused me to develop lumbar lordosis, this is a condition where there is a slight inward curve in the lower spine which causes me discomfort/ mild pain at times.  Obviously, I'll go to a physio however I'm interested to learn about other ways I can improve this issue, and pilates and yoga stood out to me. So I'm wondering will pilates and yoga (along with losing weight) help me to improve or even cure lower back pain? Many thanks :)"

pilates,Is Pilates a good way to prevent back pain in care workers?,"Hi I'm an absolute beginner to pilates. I started following a few at home workout videos during lockdown and I really enjoyed it. Since then I have been back to work as a carer and sometimes experience some lower back pain. It's not chronic pain and eases after a day or two, it's just a result of using hoists, bending over baths etc. I would like to keep my back healthy and prevent these minor pains from deteriorating into a more serious problem. I've seen yoga recommended but I think I would prefer to do pilates. Just wondering if anyone has experience or advice relating to this? Would it be worth my while starting a pilates class once gyms open again?"
pilates,Back pain from Studio Pilates,"I go to pilates studio that has many different classes  (reformer, spring board, barrel, and chair). My core is immensely weak. Like extremely weak. Maybe it atrophied. Anyway, because of this, most exercises that are meant to work the core, work other muscles. I was doing CrossFit but I'm taking a break to focus on strengthening my work and because I have damaged cartilage in my knee and it's starting to hurt more lately so I thought pilates would be a better alternative (little did I know that the cardio warm-ups would hurt my knee too). Anyway two days ago, in a barrel class, I hurt my back. I wanted to stop the movement but I felt embarrassed because my co-worker is in the same class and she's really good at pilates. I feel dumb for caring but I was very embarrassed that day because I kept messing up and I was the only one who kept messing up constantly. At the end though I told my instructor that my back hurts and she said it was because my core is very very weak. Which I know that but now two day's later it's still hurting... it's not a very intense pain. But even minor pain makes me worry because I don't want it to become intense or to become something serious. Pilates it's extremely expensive and I want to continue going to the classes... I just hate that I feel pressured to keep doing movements that feel uncomfortable or even painful. I'm not the only newbie but it seems like I'm the only newbie that flails around with no balance or mobility or control over one's body. 


I'm guessing I should talk to the instructors. If I was living in my home country or a country that English was the native language I would have been talked to the instructors before even writing this post. None of the instructors speak English. Actually one can speak a bit of conversational English but that's about it.


I have a class today and I can't cancel it so I'm going to go but it's reformer and not barrel which killed my back. I'm going to try to talk that the instructors but I'm writing this to get some advice.


I'm looking for advice on 2 things....

#1 Are there any tried and true exercises for the core that actually help someone with a weak core? When I do planks it's entirely my arms holding up my body. I break planks so fast because my arms get fatigued holding me up. 


Also this country has this really cool app where it has an AI coach. So you have to sit your phone up somewhere so that it can see your entire body on the right side of your phone screen whilst the AI coach is on the left side of your phone screen and it tells you if you're doing the movements correctly or wrong (although I find this hard cause my apartment is a box... I constantly hit the walls with my hands and have a hard time fitting my whole body into the screen because of my room size.) It's not a free app, but my membership is free as long as I'm a member of my pilates Studio. One of my pilates instructors told me to do it three times a week so I've been doing that. But I'm worried about not doing the moves correctly and messing up my back. Even though the AI tries to tell me if I'm doing it right or wrong it's hard when it can't even see my full body and I have to constantly move for each movement to try to find a space in my room that I can do the movement properly in. 


I included this because I'm already doing home training but maybe I should do something easier first? Also my instructor can track my progress on the AI coach app. 


#2 I'm also looking for advice on back/spine care. I really really don't want a herniated disc. I'm currently leaning back in my chair because that's the only way my back feels fine. If I sit up straight, it hurts which is scary because this is not a feeling I'm used to and I know it's not okay. Is is there anything I can do like some sort of stretching that I can do that will help. I no I should just stop the movements when they don't feel right but I'm so embarrassed and also my instructors push me kind of hard probably because I'm the only one struggling and they don't understand why I'm struggling maybe they think I'm doing it on purpose."
pilates,[Beginner] Hip pain when laying on my side,"Hi everyone, 

I recently started doing pilates regularly and so far I'm really enjoy it, except for one thing. I can't do exercices that require to lay on my side because I get extreme hip pain when doing so. Well actually, my hip isn't really the problem, I think it's mostly the part of the femur that sticks out. I tried using a thick and squishy mat but still, it's like my bones are sticking out too much so it hurts a lot, the only way to lay confortably on my side is to use a bed mattress or a sofa. 

Does anyone here have that problem? Is there something I can do about it? Am I positioning myself the wrong way? Is there a trick I could use to avoid suffering too much?"

pilates,Thinking of subscribing to The Pilates Class - is it worth it?,"I'm currently a first year grad student. Since freshman year and now, I've put on 30lbs and would like to lose that, with a goal of losing 10lbs by the end of the year (am I being too ambitious?). 

Due to covid, I've been stuck at home. I live with family so I can't put them at risk by going to a gym regularly. I try to get out and run, but most days I just go on a walk and do my own workout with dumbbells and ankle weights. 

I've been interested in finding a good online workout program, nothing too structured but something that helps with toning and has a variety of workouts. I recently came across TPC discount for 3 months and am thinking of doing that. I feel like this is something I could stick with and would be motivated to do everyday.

pilates,Tailbone hurts after jumping using the jump board. I’m a beginner.,Hi. I have been doing private Pilates lessons for about 2 months now. Last week my instructor introduced the jump board and we did some Pilates jumps and running in place. I think that during the jumps since I was nervous maybe I landed with my left foot first instead of both and that’s why I had pain. A few hours later I couldn’t really walk without pain and was icing myself. The pain all weekend has been on and off. It’s mostly like the left side of my tailbone but it doesn’t hurt to walk anymore it just feels kind of sore or bruised. Especially when laying down on my stomach or flat. I’m going to take a break from Pilates this week and my instructor said it isn’t a big deal but I’m kind of nervous and don’t know if this is normal or has happened before. I am also 25 years old and a female.
pilates,Tight hip flexors and disconnected back body,"Hey all!

Thanks in advance for any suggestions. Cheers!"
pilates,Weight Limits on Pilates Equipment,"Hi! 

Most comprehensive teacher training programs do not talk about working with people in larger bodies which is a shame because they spend time talking about working with seniors and pregnant people as well as how to train people with specific injuries. Because of this, the concept of weight limits on equipment has mostly been overlooked and many Pilates instructors are unaware weight capacities even exist on their equipment. If they knew there was a possibility of such a thing, they usually had to ask each manufacturer about individual pieces of equipment.  

Bringing awareness to the issue is the first step towards inclusivity and accessibility in the Pilates industry and I am THRILLED Balanced Body created [a document about weight capacities](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.pilates.com/resources/BB_WeightLimits_Capital%20Equipment.pdf) on their equipment. Other manufacturers don't even know their weight limits - and trust me I've asked quite a few. Gratz, Stott, BASI. . .  just to name a few. 

I just wanted to share the happy news here - there are so many instructors and Pilates enthusiasts in this sub."
pilates,"Hi all, I've received a few messages from Redditors concerned about the amount of self-promotional video links. It's time to ask the community if it's time to make our first rule","Up until now, I have been fairly liberal with what videos get posted so upcoming online instructors can get exposure.  The copyright for 'Pilates' was lost some 20 years ago, and the term is open for interpretation; I only removed videos that fragrantly misuse the word 'Pilates' in my opinion, and leave it up to the community to upvote/downvote.

The majority of our community appear to be newcomers to the Pilates world, I think this has lead to some questionable videos rising to the top of the subreddit. After receiving a few messages from users concerned about this, I think it's time to take action.  


My personal opinion is that we continue to allow self-promotional videos, but set a rule that the instructor has to hold a fully-comprehensive qualification, or if they're not qualified, they appear to competently teach comprehensive Pilates.   
This would dramatically reduce the amount of self-promotional posts while still helping professional instructors gain an online presence and only expose newcomers to professional instructors.   


This will be a group decision, what do you think we should do? All opinions welcome.

pilates,"Pilates, posture and progress!","I first started reformer/apparatus Pilates with the aim of sorting my posture out. I’ve always been very round shouldered with a strong kyphosis, with pain in my thoracic ribs and spine since my teens.

2 years later, my pain is 90% resolved. My upper body posture has not changed much, but that’s because I’m discovered all the OTHER things I need to change first! And they have changed heaps!

In weekly 1:1s I discovered i could not activate my glutes. She’d give me the most painful, sensation-heavy exercises and... nada. We had to slowly train my body to activate that muscle group, and be able to recruit them on demand.

Then we noticed I tend to put all my weight on my heels. This causes me to overextend and lock my knees, and as a result (or maybe because?), the back of my calves are super short and tight. Lots of stretching and strength-building for the back of the leg, over lots of months. I loved the changes to my movement patterns so much that I bought a home reformer and tower combo and started practicing most days around my 1:1s.

Next we found I couldn’t hinge properly at my pelvis. It was like my brain just never got the operating manual for that particular movement, and so we had to teach my body, in slow repetitions, how to initiate that tip and tilt at the pelvis. 

We haven’t even got to my upper body yet, but already my stature and shape and movement patterns are unrecognisable. Now I understand why all those upper body posture braces and aids and even physio sessions never worked - posture problems can be SEEN in the shoulders and upper back but they start everywhere else! And you can’t change the house without fixing the foundations first!

I wish someone had told me this 10 years ago! And I hope this isn’t discouraging to anyone else working on posture - I know 2 years feels like a long time, and not everyone can access 1:1 classes and home apparatus, but I don’t think the *how* is what matters. It was my observations about my body and movement that triggered all of this new understanding.
The important thing is seeing your body as a whole, and finding the balance, strength and flexibility that Pilates is all about ❤️"

pilates,Need Pilate/Fitness Mat Buying Guidance,"Hey Reddit,

I'm after some help for choosing a mat that works well for Pilates but also for some aerobic type excercise such as jumping jacks, high knees, ski jumps, etc. 

My market area is Australia.

I currently use a 173x61x10mm fitness mat from Kmart and I'm looking to upgrade as it's PVC and flakes apart destroying the earth. 

I'd like to, if possible, stay away from PVC and get something that's a minimum of 183x60x6mm. I like the idea of something longer and potentially wider if it suits. 

I've heard great things about Airex as they're good for rehabilitation and pilates (currently dealing with low back pain). 

These are the mats I've been looking at but open to ideas:

Airex Calyana Pro mat - I like the dimensions of this a lot but I'm unsure of the 6.8mm thickness. 
185cm x 85cm x 6.6mm

Airex 190 Pilate mat- this seems nice too but I'm wondering if 8mm is to thin and the 60cm too narrow. 190cm x 60cm x 8mm

Airex Coronella - Also nice, is 15mm better for Pilates and fitness? Also wondering about the 60cm. 200/185cm x 60cm x 15mm

Phatmat mat - TPE yoga mat, doubles sided and says it's good for Pilates and general exercise. 
183cm x 61cm X 10mm

Mahalo Natural Rubber Mat. Not sure about the 5mm thickness but the dimensions are good.
186cm x 68cm x 5mm

Adidas 10mm Fitness Mat - I've heard mixed things about NBR , this mat is general length but okay. 
183cm x 61cm x 10mm

Sorry, heaps of info but I'm lost in the world of mats. Haha. 

Just after something that's decent quality, doesn't stretch and flake but is good as an all rounder and good for the joints when doing rolls and jumping around. Would be good if I could use shoes as well but that's not priority. My floor is hardwood. 

Thanks for any help!!

Edit: I'm 6ft, 90kg - in not too bad of shape."
pilates,Mari Winsor Accelerator,I have the Mari Winsor Accelerator and was curious if anyone on here has done the intermediate and advanced workout calendar schedule on what used to be the [winsorslim.com](https://winsorslim.com) site (no longer operational) and if anyone has a copy of those calendars? Thoughts on it as an at home alternative to reformer?
pilates,Recommendations on a Pilates Reformer for home use?,"With the pandemic I stopped going to my Pilates studio in March and I don’t see myself being able to return within a year at least.

I’m looking to buy a reformer for my home gym in my basement. I’ve only ever used Balanced Body in the studios I’ve gone to and I think the IQ model might be a good fit.

Does anyone have a reformer at home? What make/model is it and are you happy with it? 

I’m willing to spend $$ since I plan to use this indefinitely (and often; I was going to the studio 5x/week). 

Thanks in advance for all your recommendations!"

pilates,Help with New Instructor Practice,"I recently got certified with Peak Pilates Level 1 earlier this year. The cert was great but I feel like I missed out on a lot of in-person practice because one weekend was over Zoom due to shutdown. Even getting the required practice hours was personal or over Zoom with the other students. Others in my class already had jobs lined up or access to equipment but I didn't have either. After months I finally was able to get an instructor interview but for the practical portion I wasn't totally comfortable.. they're giving me another shot in January so I really need to practice.
Is there any way to practice with a class or just to get in front of a reformer?"
pilates,Private Pilates Instruction,"My wife has been a Pilates instructor for several years, and she is considering setting up a private instruction studio in our home to do one on one coaching.  We are struggling to find what kind of hourly rates are reasonable for both in-studio reformer instruction and in-home (at the client's home) mat Pilates.  

If any of you doing private instruction would be willing to share your rates, we would be very appreciative.

Thanks!"
pilates,Smaller Reformer Flow Help?,"I currently have the Aeropilates Plus 379 (itching for the larger Allegro 2 I used back at the studio I went to, but can’t afford it right now.)

I was curious if there were websites or videos for good flows on the smaller reformer. It’s honestly really bothering me that I can’t do what I did back in studio because my reformer is shorter..."
pilates,Liability Insurance Question,"Hi everyone, 

I'm in the process of getting certified and need to purchase general liability insurance. Any suggestions? What I've been finding seems to be more for small businesses, rather than an individual instructor...does this seem correct?

Thank you!"
pilates,Snapping hip syndrome,"Does anyone have any fave reformer or tower exercises to target weak hip rotators and right hip flexors, to try and reduce snapping hip? 

I find it’s less of a problem when I’m working with more weight, eg adding an extra spring for feet in straps. Can anyone explain the physics of that to me? 

I normally have weekly 1:1 sessions but due to lockdown can’t access my teacher, and would love to work on this while I’m at home with my reformer/tower combo."

pilates,question about peak Cadillac/reformer combo,"I have an older TWS from peak with a tower.  I want to convert it to a reformer/cadillac if they sell a kit to do it.

pilates,AeroPilates Premier Reformer,"Hi,
Does anyone have an AeroPilates Premier Reformer with 4 cords?  Do you like it?  Do you use it at home?   I’m thinking of buying a pre- owned one for my home since it’s tough to get to classes right now.  I just want to make sure I’m not pouring money down the drain on something I’ll never use at home once I get it.  I also want to make sure people have good things to say about this model of reformer.  Also, if anyone has any suggestions for other reformers on the lower end of the price range please let me know!!  TIA!!"
pilates,Looking for Advisors,"Hello! I developed an app for fitness professionals, and in particular Pilates instructors. I am looking to make a small team of professional advisors to improve the app. 

An advisor would use the app with clients and fellow teachers and give feedback to the developers. I am looking for professionals who are growing their businesses and who like to engage their clients outside of their regular session time.

The app is called Prospire, it is a digital note taking, progress tracking, and engagement tool that is meant to transform the lives of instructors and their clients. The app is free for limited time, so if you would like to take a look, please feel free to download it!

pilates,"Elbow tendinitis from too much reformer, too soon.","I’m experiencing a flair up of some elbow tendinitis after overdoing Reformer classes.

I’ve experienced this before in the gym when it became months long issue.

I signed up for a trial membership at a new, local studio and my enthusiasm has gotten the better of me as I can only assume I’m overdoing it.

I’ve been doing a 50 min class every day for the last 9 days which in hindsight seems a bit excessive I guess?

Thoughts on managing elbow tendinitis and optimal class frequency for a 53M with years of gym experience."
pilates,Is anyone getting great tone and physique through Pilates alone?,"I just got done with my first session and I walked away fascinated. I ended up buying more sessions. Pilates feels like we're solving problems using precise movements vs aggressively tackling problems with as much resistance as we can handle. At first I didn't feel like we did anything but then when I left the building I realized my body had done more than I thought.

The one thing I couldn't stop noticing is but didn't bother to ask my instructor was how well toned he was. Has anyone achieved this through Pilates alone?"

pilates,I keep getting lower back pain after practicing!,"I just started Pilates a few weeks ago. A few days after doing it for the first time, I had moderate lower back pain that eventually became severe lower back spasms. I took a week or so off after this.

I just started up again 3 days ago and for the past 2 days I've again had moderate lower back pain.

I can't help but think it's connected. 

Any experience with this?"
pilates,Advice for hyper mobility getting started with Pilates,"F23 5’3 CW233 
Hey there! I recently read a post about Pilates being a good option for people with hyper mobility with their joints. I have decided to take control of my health and have been monitoring my food while slowly adding in exercise. I really enjoy Zumba and jazzercise but my ankles and knees have a very hard time with it. I have never tried Pilates but have been looking into it since I saw that post. Does anyone have recommendations on where to start? I figure I will just find some beginner classes and jump into it. But it never hurts to ask advice. Thank you in advance!"
